卡尔·马克思确实是魔教成员（中英对照）



名词简释：  

  

Satan -- 撒殚，是犹太基督系宗教里的恶魔之王。  

Lucifer -- 路斯弗，堕落天使。  

Abyss -- 无底地狱。佛教中亦有阿鼻地狱（Abichi Hell）之说。

......  

  

  

马克思主义源自一个撒殚教秘密组织 --- 很少马克思主义者知道这一点。  

  

The origin of Marxism is within a satanic mystery cult - something which very

few Marxists are aware.  

  

......  

  

  

马克思早年是一名基督徒。马克思第一部知名作品叫《基督信徒们依据約翰福音15:1-14而合一：合一的意义、必要性及其影响》。里面有这样的话：“与基督的合一，既在和祂紧密而鲜活的友谊之中，又在这样的事实当中：祂总在我们眼前和我们心里。同时，我们被祂的大爱占据，于是，通过那联合了我们、牺牲了自己的祂，我们对兄弟真心相待。”  

  

In early youth, Marx was a Christian. The first of Marx's known works was

entitled, "Unity of believers in Christ according to the Gospel of John

15:1-14: Unity's meaning, unconditional necessity, and influence." Here we

find the following words: "Union with Christ is found in a close and living

fellowship with Him and in the fact that we always have Him before our eyes

and in our hearts. And at the same time that we are possessed by the greatest

love of Him, we direct our hearts to our brothers, with whom He bound us

closely, and for whom He sacrificed Himself."  

  

  

可见马克思知道人们表达兄弟情谊的方式，那就是：通过基督教。  

  

So Marx was aware of the way in which people may show brotherly love towards

each other, that is, through Christianity.  

  

  

马克思继续写道：“因此，与基督的合一，使我们的内在升华，使考验得到慰籍，使我们心灵敞开关爱他人 --- 这不是因为我们骄傲或渴望名声，而是因为基督。”  

  

He continues: "Therefore, unity with Christ internally exalts, comforts in

trials, and makes the heart open to love people, not because of our pride or

thirst for fame, but because of Christ."  

  

  

几乎与此同时，马克思在《一个年轻人在择业前的思考》中写道：  

  

“宗教授予我们所有人向往的理想。祂为全人类牺牲了自己。谁敢否认这一点？若我们选择的职业，能让我们把自己最好的给予人类，我们就不会在其重压下蹒跚行走，因为这是献给万物的牺牲。”  

  

At the about the same period of time, he writes in his work entitled:

"Thoughts of a young man before choosing a profession":  

  

"Religion teaches us the Ideal to Whom we all aspire. He has sacrificed

Himself for all mankind. Who will dare to deny such assertions? If we have

chosen a profession at which we may give our best to mankind, then we won't

falter under its burden, because it is a sacrifice for all."  

  

  

马克思从高校毕业时，他的文凭里注明了他的宗教知识：  

  

“他的基督教理知识，是明晰、且相当有根基的。而且，他对基督教会的历史非常了解。”  

  

When he graduated from high school, his diploma contained the following in the

category "Religious knowledge":  

  

"His knowledge of Christian teachings and principles is clear and properly

based. He also knows the history of Christian church to a great extent."  

  

  

马克思获得文凭不久，一件非常灵异之事发生了。在 Moses Gess 于 1841

年把马克思导向社会主义信念之前，他已成为一名热烈的无神论者。这种性格转变，在其学生时代的后期表现出来。  

  

Soon after receiving of his diploma, something very mysterious happened. Even

before Moses Gess led Marx to socialistic persuasions in 1841, he had become a

zealous atheist. This change character could be seen in his later student

years.  

  

  

在他的诗词中，马克思写道：“我渴望向上帝复仇。”马克思相信上帝确实存在，虽然上帝从未伤害他，他却要与祂争斗。马克思生于一个较富裕的家庭，他在童年时从未挨饿，在学生时代的生活又比他的朋友们好得多。那么，他对神的强烈仇恨从何而来？  

  

In one of his verses, Marx wrote: "I long to take vengeance on the One Who

rules from above." Marx believed that "the One that rules from above" in fact

existed. He contended with Him, although God never harmed him. Marx was from a

relatively wealthy family. He didn't starve in his childhood and in his

student years he lived much better than his friends. So what caused his fierce

hatred towards God?  

  

  

我们尚未知晓其个人动机。或者，在这挑衅的声言中，马克思只是“另一位”的喉舌？  

  

Personal motivations are not available to us. Maybe Marx was only somebody's

else speaker in this defiant assertion?  

  

  

在此时期，马克思的一首诗《堕入绝望的魔咒》中写道：  

  

“我将在上苍设立我的王座，寒冷与恐惧是其顶点，迷信的战栗是其基座，而其主人，就是那最黑暗的极度痛苦。  

  

以健康观点看待世界的人，将会转变，变得惨白和死寂。他被盲目和寒冷的死亡所占据，将给他的快乐准备坟墓。”  

  

During this period, the following lines are taken from him from the poem

entiled: "Conjuration of falling into despair."  

  

I'll set up my throne above, Cold and terrible will be the peak of it.

Superstitious trembling is at its base, Master - most black agony.  

  

The one who will look with healthy looks, Will turn away, turn pale and deadly

mute. Possessed by blind and cold deathness, will prepare a tomb with his

happiness.  

  

  

坐于王座上的“那一位”，将散布极端的痛苦与恐惧 ---

这个自白和“我将在上苍设立我的王座”一句，使我们想起了路斯弗的骄傲之言：“我要升到天上，在神的众星之上，我将设立我的王座。”（圣经·旧约·以赛亚书

14:13）  

  

The words "I'll set up my throne" and his confession that agony and fear will

go forth from the one who is sitting upon the throne, remind us Lucifer's

proud boast: "I will ascend to heaven, higher than God's stars I will set up

my throne" (Isiah 14:13).  

  

  

为何马克思需要这样一个王座？马克思在其学生时代写的一个声名狼藉的剧本中，有着答案。这个剧本叫《Oulanem》，里面提及撒殚教的“黑色聚会” ---

这种祭典仪式由一名祭师带领，于午夜时分焚烧一部《圣经》；聚会者发誓要犯（罗马天主教教义中的）全部七宗致命大罪，且永远不做好事；然后，他们进行纵欲狂欢。  

  

Why did Marx need such a throne? The answer for this question is in an

infamous drama written by Marx in his student years. The drama is called

"Oulanem." There is a mention of a satanic "Black mass," a ritual conducted by

a priest at midnight in which a Bible is burned. All present promise to commit

all the seven deadly sins mentioned in the Roman Catholic catechism and to

never perform any good works. An orgy follows after that.  

  

  

撒殚崇拜由来已久。在《圣经·旧约·申命记》中我们读到，那些人“向魔鬼献祭”，然后，以色列之王 Jeroboam 设立了高位、牛羊的祭师。  

  

Worship of Satan is very old. In Deuteronomy we read that the Jews "made

sacrifices to demons" (32:17). Later, the king of Israel, Jeroboam, set up

priests of the high places and of the goats and bulls that he made"(2 Kings

12:25-33).  

  

  

为了理解《Oulanem》，我们可以读一下马克思在《Nidler》一诗中的奇异自白：  

  

“地狱之气升起并充满我的头脑，这将使我发疯，并使我的心发生戏剧性变化。看见这把剑了吗？黑暗之王把它卖给了我。”  

  

The "Oulanem" can be understood if we read with Marx's bizarre confession made

in the verse "Nidler":  

  

Hellish evaporations rise and fill my brains, Until I will go mad and my heart

will not change dramatically. See this sword? The King of darkness sold it to

me.  

  

  

这些字句有特殊意义：在撒殚教的晋阶祭仪中，一柄施了巫术、能确保某种成功的剑，会被卖给晋阶者。而晋阶者付出的代价，就是用他血管里的血在恶魔契约上签字，于是，在他死后，他的灵魂将属于撒殚。  

  

These lines have special meaning when we take into account that during the

rituals of higher dedication into a satanic cult, a bewitched sword that

guarantees a success is sold to the candidate. He pays for it by signing with

his blood taken from his vein the contract which makes his soul belong to

Satan after death.  

  

  

以下摘自《Oulanem》：  

  

“因为他正在抽空给予记号。我的死亡之舞越来越大胆，而他们也是这样：Oulanem，Oulanem。这名字听起来如同死亡，这声音一直持续，使我们在悲惨的形态中不能自已。停止吧！现在我已拥有它。它从我的灵魂升起，如空气般清晰，如骨骼般坚硬。接下来，你，人格化的人类，我会用我强力的手抓住你，同时用暴烈的力量把你压碎。黑暗中，无底地狱的裂口对我张开，而你也不能幸免，你将堕入其中，我会紧随你之后。大笑和低语声将传入你的耳朵：“下来陪我吧，朋友！”

”  

  

And now I'll quote "Oulanem":  

  

For he is marking time and giving signs. Bolder and bolder I play the dance of

death. And they too: Oulanem, Oulanem. This name sounds like death, Sounds

until won't stop in miserable shapes. Halt! Now I have it. It rises from my

soul, Clear as air, hard as my bones. And still, you personified mankind, I

may take you by the power of my mighty hands and crush with fierce force In

the meantime, as the abyss gapes before me and you in the darkness, You will

fall in it and I'll follow you, Laughing and whispering into your ear: "Come

down with me, friend!"  

  

  

马克思在高校所学的圣经中说，魔鬼被一位天使投入无底地狱之中（圣经·启示录20:3）。这无底地狱是预备给魔鬼和堕落天使的，马克思却想将全人类投入这地狱之中。  

  

The Holy Scripture, which Marx learned in high school, says that devil was

cast down by an angel into the abyss (Rev. 20:3). Marx wanted to send all

mankind into this abyss prepared for the devil and his angels.  

  

  

在这个剧本里，谁在代表马克思说话呢？从这个年轻人之言，我们有理由这样构想：他梦想人类会堕入无底地狱，而他自己，则会大笑着尾随那些被无神论诱骗的人们。除了撒殚教会的晋阶祭仪之外，世上没有任何地方会有这种理念。  

  

Who speaks for Marx in this drama? Is it reasonable to expect this from such a

young man - that he would dream that mankind would fall into the abyss (the

"outer darkness" as the Bible calls it), and that he himself laughing will

follow those who were ensnared by unbelief? Nowhere in the world is this idea

cultivated except in the rituals of dedication into the higher degrees of the

Satanic church.  

  

  

《Oulanem》里死亡的时刻来临时，马克思写道：  

  

“毁灭，毁灭。我的时候已到。时钟停止了，那微小的建筑倒塌了。很快我将紧抱永恒，并伴随着一声狂野的嘶吼，说出对全人类的诅咒。”  

  

The time to die has come for Oulanem. These are his words:  

  

Perished, perished. My time is over. The clock has stopped, the tiny building

has fallen. Soon I'll squeeze eternity to me, and with a wild cry Will speak

out a curse to all mankind.  

  

  

马克思喜欢复述哥德的《浮士德》中恶魔 Mephistopheles 的话：“一切存在都应该被毁灭。” 一切 ---

包括工人和那些为共产主义而战的人。马克思喜欢引用这话，而斯大林则忠实执行之，甚至连他自己的家庭都毁掉了。  

  

Marx liked to repeat Mephistopheles' words from Goethe's "Faust": "all

existing is worthy to be destroyed." All, including the worker and those who

fought for communism in battle. Marx liked to quote these words and Stalin

acted according to these words and destroyed even his own family.  

  

  

撒殚教的成员并非唯物主义者，他们相信死后的生命。Oulanem，这个马克思担任的角色，并不否认死后的生命，而是认为死后的生命充满了最高的仇恨。需要说明的是，对于众魔而言，“永恒”意同“苦刑”。正是因此，众魔指责耶稣：“神的儿子，我们与你有什么相干。时候还没到，你就来让我们受苦吗”（

圣经·新约·马太福音 8:29）  

  

Members of Satan's cult are not materialists. They believe in life after

death. Oulanem, the person whose character Marx assumes, does not deny life

after death. But acknowledges it as a life full of hate to the highest degree.

I should mention that "eternity" means "torture" to demons. This is the reason

why demons rebuked Jesus: "And so they cried out: what do you have to do with

us, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come to torture us before our time" (Matt.

8:29).  

  

  

马克思说了同样的话：  

  

“哈，永恒，我们永远的痛苦，无法描述、无法衡量的灭亡！它是如此可憎，被造作出来，以蔑视我们 ---

而我们本身，作为盲目的时钟机器，生来就是时间和空间的愚蠢日历，我们只是为了毁灭而昙花一现，除此之外，绝无其它目标。”  

  

Marx says the same thing:  

  

Hah, eternity, our eternal pain, Indescribable, unmeasurable death!

Disgusting, artificially conceived, To despise us - We, who ourselves, as a

clock mechanism Blindly mechanical, created to be Foolish calendars of time

and space, Without any purpose, Besides accidental appearance for destruction.  

  

  

我们开始明白青年马克思身上发生什么了。他曾经有基督教的理想，但并没有付诸实践。他与其父的通信证明，他花费了大量金钱用于娱乐，并因此导致他与父母之间无尽的矛盾冲突。在这种情况下，他可能已陷入一个秘密撒殚教组织的罗网，并经历了献祭仪式。撒殚能在其教徒纵欲狂欢的迷幻中显现，并能通过他们的嘴说话。当马克思宣称：“我要向上帝复仇”时，他显然就是撒殚的代言人。  

  

We begin to realize what happened to young Marx. He used to have Christian

ideals, but he didn't applying them to his life. His correspondence with his

father testifies of spending of large amounts of money for entertainment that

caused endless conflicts with his parents. In this situation, he possibly was

entangled in the snare of a secret Satanic cult and went through the ritual of

dedication. Satan is seen by his followers in hallucinations during the orgies

and speaks through their mouths. Marx is just Satan's voice when he proclaims

"I want to take vengeance on the One who is above."  

  

  

让我们看看《Oulanem》剧本的结尾吧：  

  

“哈！在火轮上受刑之时，我必须愉快地在这永恒之环上跳舞：如果它之外还有任何东西，我情愿跳进去，即使为此而毁灭世界，我也在所不惜。  

  

把它和我联系起来吧！它必会被诅咒毁灭。我会用我的双手镇压不听话的存在。拥抱着我，它会平静地消褪，然后沉入乌有之处。完全消失，不复存在，那就是 - 生命。”  

  

Let's go to the end of "Oulanem" drama:  

  

Hah! Tortured on the burning wheel, I must happily dance in the circle of

eternity: If there would be anything beyond it, I'd jump into it, even if I

had to destroy the world for it.  

  

Build between it and me! It must be destroyed with curses. I'll supress

stubborn existence by my hands. Embracing me, it should calmly fade out. And

then - down to nowhere. Completely disappear, and not to be - that would be -

the life.  

  

  

在这《Oulanem》剧本中，马克思实际上做了与魔鬼等同之事，他诅咒了全人类。  

  

In the "Oulanem" drama Marx, in fact, does the same thing as the devil. He

curses all humanity.  

  

  

《Oulanem》这种剧本，可能是世上唯一的：在它里面，所有角色都确知他们的罪孽并纵情狂欢，如同过节日一般。那里没有黑与白，没有Claudio，Ophelia，Iago

和 Desdemona。在这剧本里，一切都是黑暗的，而且所有人都表现出恶魔 Mephistopheles 的性格。里面的所有祈祷都是邪恶的，注定要被毁灭。  

  

"Oulanem" is probably the only drama in the world in which all the players are

so sure of their sinfulness and revel in it as on a holiday. There is neither

white nor black, neither Claudio and Ophelia, Iago and Desdemona. Everything

is black in it, and every one appeared to have Mephistopheles' character. All

of it's players are demonic and doomed to perish.  

  

  

马克思写作《Oulanem》时，这位年轻的才子仅 18

岁。此时，他为自己一生定下的计划已非常清晰。他没有幻想要为人类、无产阶级、或社会主义服务。他想毁灭这个世界，以世界的震荡、剧痛、动乱为基础，建起他的王座。  

  

When Marx was writing "Oulanem," the young genius was 18. His plan for his

life was very clear by that time. He had no illusions about serving mankind,

the proletariat or socialism. He wanted to destroy the world, set up a throne

for himself that would be based upon the world's shocks, throes and

convulsions.  

  

  

在此阶段，马克思的观点继续发展。一些灵异之事在他与其父的通信之中出现。例如，马克思写道：“外壳脱落了，我的众圣之圣已被掏空，那个地方需要一位新的灵。”---

写于1837

年11月10日，在此之前，这位年轻人已被承认为基督徒。他曾公开宣称基督住在他的心中，没想到突然之间，这就被完全颠覆了。是什么新的灵取代了基督的位置呢？  

  

At this stage, Marx's views were developing. Some mysterious things appear in

his correspondence with his father. For instance, the son writes: "The cover

has fallen, my Holy of Holies was emptied and there was a need to put new gods

there." This was written on November 10, 1837 by the young fellow who

previously professed to be a Christian. He used to profess that Christ

inhabited in his heart. Suddenly this turned upside-down. What new gods

replaced Christ's place?  

  

  

马克思的父亲回复道（1838年2月10日）：“我不需要关于这灵异事件的任何解释，尽管它貌似颇具争议性。”那灵异事件是什么？没有传记作者能解释这些迷一般的话。  

  

Marx's father replied (February 10, 1838): "I didn't demand any explanations

about such a mysterious thing, though it seems to be very controversial." What

was that mysterious thing? No biographer has been able to explain these

puzzling words.  

  

  

是什么突然的“争议性”转变发生在马克思身上，导致马克思的父亲表现出焦虑呢？  

  

What suddenly caused young Marx's father to express anxiety for controversial

influences on his young son?  

  

  

在一首诗里，马克思写道：  

  

“我确知，我已失去天堂。我那曾经信仰上帝的灵魂，现在已注定要下地狱。”  

  

In a poem, Karl Marx wrote:  

  

I have lost heaven, And know that for sure. My soul, once faithful to God, Now

is destined for hell.  

  

  

我们无须多解释了。  

  

We need not comment.  

  

  

马克思早年对艺术有傲然的抱负，他的诗词、剧本，对于探索其内心世界相当重要；不过，由于他缺乏诗人天赋，这些作品始终没被采纳。在绘画和建筑学上的失败造就了希特勒；在戏剧上的失败造就了Goebels；在哲学上的失败造就了Rosenberg。  

  

Marx began with proud ambitions in art. His verse and drama were important for

the discovery of his inner world, but because of the absence of poetic talent,

they remained useless. Failures in painting and architecture gave us Hitler;

in drama - Goebels; in philosophy - Rosenberg.  

  

  

马克思是所有神明的死对头 --- 一个以自己灵魂为代价，从黑暗王子那里买了一把剑的人。  

  

Marx was the implacable enemy of all gods, a man who bought a sword from the

prince of darkness for the price of his own soul.  

  

  

马克思真的向撒殚买了一把剑吗？  

  

Did Marx really buy a sword from the Satan?  

  

  

马克思的女儿 Eleonora 写了一本书，名叫《摩尔人与将军 -

马克思与恩格斯回忆录》。她说，在她小时候，卡尔给她和她的姐妹们讲了许多故事。她特别喜欢的故事与一个叫Hans

Rekle的人有关。这个故事被连续讲了几个月，且似乎永不完结。Hans Rekle

是一名巫师，他有一间玩偶商店，并有巨额负债。他是巫师，但他却经常缺钱。因此，无论他是否情愿，他必须将那些可爱的玩偶一个接一个地卖给魔鬼。Eleonora

写道，这些冒险中的一些事颇为恐怖，简直令她汗毛倒竖。  

  

His daughter, Eleonora, wrote book entitled: "The Moor and the general -

memoirs of Marx and Engels." She says that Karl told many stories to her and

his other daughter when they were children. Her favorite story was about some

one named Hans Rekle. This story was continued for months and seemed to never

end. Hans Rekle was a wizard who had a toy shop and a lot of debts. Though he

was wizard, he constantly was in need of money. Therefore, in spite of his

desire, he had to sell all his cute toys one by one to the devil. Eleonora

wrote that some of these adventures were so awful that her hair stood on end.  

  

  

Robert Payne 在其《马克思》一书中，通过引用 Eleonora 的话道出了详情：可怜的 Rekle

巫师极不情愿卖掉他的玩偶，他总是把玩偶保留到最后一刻；然而，由于他与魔鬼有一个协定，他无法逃避。  

  

Robert Payne, in his book "Marx," also tells in detail, from Eleonora's words,

how the poor wizard Rekle unwillingly was selling his toys keeping them until

the very last moment. But because he had an agreement with devil, he was

unable to escape.  

  

  

这位传记作家评论道：“受惊之后，我们可以猜想，那些永不完结的故事，就是马克思的自传。有时他似乎意识到他在行使魔鬼的职责。”马克思写作《Oulanem》和另一些早期作品时，尚未构想社会主义。在这些早期作品中，马克思承认他与撒殚签了契约。  

  

The biographer comments: "Scarely can we doubt that those never ending stories

were autobiographic. Sometimes it seemed as though he was realizing that he

was performing the devil's duty." Marx didn't conceive of socialism when was

finishing "Oulanem" and other early works in which he admits he made a pact

with Satan.  

  

  

那时马克思遇见了Moses Gess --- 一个在马克思生命中扮演了最重要角色，并引导其接受了社会主义理念的人。  

  

At that time Marx met Moses Gess, the man who played most significant role in

his life and led Marx to accept socialistic ideals.  

  

  

在给B. Auerbasch 的一封信（1841）中，Gess 称马克思是“最伟大的，更可能是唯一的，当代哲学家......

马克思博士非常年轻（最多24岁），他将给予宗教和哲学终极打击。”可见，其首要目标是打击宗教，而不是实现社会主义。  

  

In a letter to B. Auerbasch (1841), Gess characterized Marx as "the greatest,

possibly the only, philosopher of today ... Dr. Marx is very young (24 years

old at the most); he'll strike the final blow on religion and philosophy." So

the first target was to strike a blow to religion not socialism.  

  

  

马克思追求着一种帮助人类的理想，并认为宗教是实现此理想的障碍，所以他采取了反宗教的立场 -----

这只是一个虚构的故事。实际上，马克思憎恨所有神明，而且不堪听闻上帝。社会主义只是引诱无产阶级和知识分子去实现撒殚理想的圈套而已。  

  

It is a myth that Marx had been pursuing the ideal of helping mankind, that

religion was the obstacle on the way to the realization of those ideals, and

that this was the reason why he took an anti-religious position. On the

contrary, Marx hated all gods and couldn't hear about God. Socialism was only

a decoy to attract the proletariat and intelligensia to the realization of a

satanic ideal.  

  

  

马克思很少公开谈论形而上之事，但我们可以从他交往的人那里，收集关于他观点的信息。他在“第一国际”的一名同事，俄国无政府主义者 Mikhail

Bakunin，曾写道：“魔鬼就是第一个自由思想家和救世主，魔鬼解放了阿丹，并用人性之印封住了阿丹的脸，从而使他反叛上帝。”  

  

Marx publicly spoke about metaphysics very little, but we can gather

information about his views from those with whom he communicated. One of his

co-members in the First International was Mikhail Bakunin - a Russian

anarchist who wrote that the devil was the first free thinker and the world

savior; that the devil liberated Adam and sealed his face with the seal of

humanism making him disobedient.  

  

  

Bakunin

不仅赞颂路斯弗，他还有具体的革命计划，不过，这计划并不能解救被压迫的穷人。他写道：“在这革命中，我们必须把人们心中的魔鬼唤醒，以激起他们最卑鄙的激情。”  

  

Bakunin not only glorified Lucifer, but had a concrete program of revolution -

but not the kind that is able to free the poor from oppression. He wrote: "In

this revolution, we'll have to wake up the devil in people in order to stir up

their lowest passions."  

  

  

这里有一个特别重要的事实需要说明，那就是，马克思及其朋友，作为反对神明者，并非现代马克思主义者自称的无神论者。虽然马克思他们公开否认神明，但对于他们所憎恨的神的存在，他们从未怀疑过。  

  

Here it is very important to give special signicficance to the fact that Marx

and his friends, being against God, were not atheists as modern Marxists call

themselves. Although they denied God publicly, they hated the One Whose

existence they never doubted.  

  

  

所有活跃的撒殚教徒都有混乱的个人生活，马克思也不例外。Arnold Kunzli

在《马克思心志》一书中写道，马克思因为他导致两个女儿和一个义子自杀而感到内疚；而马克思的女儿Laura 则埋葬了她的三个亲生骨肉，然后与她丈夫一起自杀。  

  

All active Satanists have a disorderly personal life, Marx was no exception.

Arnold Kunzli, in his book, "Marx - Psychography," wrote that Marx was guilty

of causing the suicide of two of his daughters and one son-in-law. His

daughter Laura also buried three of her own children and then committed

suicide together with her husband.  

  

  

在兑换交易中，马克思损失了大量金钱。作为一位耀眼的经济学家，他却亏损了不少钱财。  

  

Marx had lost a lot of money on the exchange. Being a brilliant economist, he

nevertheless could only loose money.  

  

  

由于撒殚教里一切事物都要保密，我们只能怀疑马克思加入了撒殚教；而马克思那不规矩的生活，也可以为我们提供一些线索。  

  

Since everything in a satanic cult is covered by secrecy, we only have a

suspicion that Marx had ties to the cult. His slovenly life could be one more

in the chain of evidence.  

  

  

马克思和恩格斯都是高级知识分子，然而，在他们的通信中，却充满了猥亵下流之语，这与他们的社会地位极不相称。除了大量淫秽之辞，我们找不到这两位理想家交流他们的人道主义和社会主义梦想的只言片语。  

  

Marx was a highly intelligent person, as was Engels, however their

correspondence full of indecencies which are unusual for men of their social

position. A lot of obscene words, but never do we read of these idealists

communicating their humanistic or socialistic dreams.  

  

  

马克思的行为充满了魔的特征。他的朋友Weitling

写道：“与马克思谈话时，话题通常是无神论、断头台、黑格尔、绳索、刀。”身为犹太教徒，他却写了一本反教义的书，名叫《对犹太教的质疑》。他不仅憎恨犹太人，也憎恨德国人。他声言：“只有棍棒才能唤起德国人。”他惯于谈论“哑的德国”，并称“德国人、中国人、犹太人都像街头小贩。”最后，他又说：“德国全国性的狭隘思维真令人厌恶。”（A.

Kunzli《马克思心志》）他认为俄国人是最低等的民族 -- “一个野蛮种族”，又将斯拉夫人称作“种族垃圾”。  

  

Everything in Marx' behavior had a demonic character. His friend Weitling

wrote: "Usual topics for conversation with Marx are atheism, the guillotine,

Hegel, rope and knife." Being a Jew himself, he wrote an anti-semetic book

called, "The Jewish Question." He hated not only Jews. He hated Germans and

asserted that "only a stick can raise a German." He use to talk about "the

dumb German nation" and the fact that "German, Chinese and Jewish people can

be compared to the street vendors." Finally, he makes mentions of "the

disgusting national narrow-mindedness of Germans" (A. Kunzli "Marx -

Psychography.") He counted Russians as a people of the lowest sort, "a

barbarian race," and called Slavics - "ethnic garbage."  

  

  

So we have paid some attention to several inclinations that allow us to

believe that Marx may well ahve been a Satanist.  

  

  

这里又有一个有趣的事实：一名马克思的信徒，Reese

军官，为马克思的死而哀伤，因此去了伦敦拜访他挚爱导师的故居。马克思的家人已经搬走，因此他只能跟屋里的仆人交谈。这仆人所说的关于马克思的话，令他大为惊异：“他是一位对神有着敬畏的人。在他病重时，他惯于在房间里，在一些燃烧的蜡烛前独自祈祷；围绕他头部的伤痕就像带子一样。”这使我们想起了犹太教徒早晨的祈祷仪式，不过，马克思是在基督教会受洗的，他从未声明自己信仰犹太教，而且他后来成了神的敌人。他写了多本反对宗教信仰的书，并把他的所有孩子培养成无神论者。那么，这位未受过教育的仆人理解成祈祷的仪式，到底是什么呢？犹太教徒面对圣物祈祷时，并不需要在面前放置一排蜡烛。那会不会是撒殚教的一种仪式呢？  

  

Here is one more interesting fact. Captain Reese, a disciple of Marx, grieved

by the news of his death, went to London to visit the house where his beloved

teacher once lived. The Marx family had already left the home and he was only

able to talk to the servant who lived in the same house. He heard the

following amazing words about Marx from her: "He was a man with the fear of

God. When he was very ill, he used to pray alone in his room before burning

candles, wound round his head was something like tape." This reminds

philacteries used by the Jews during their morning prayers. But Marx was

baptized in a Christian church. He never confessed Judaism and later became an

enemy of God. He had been writing books against religion and had brought up

all his children to be atheists. So what was that ceremony which the

uneducated servant understood to be a prayer? Praying Jews with phylacteries

on their face never place a row of candles before them. Could it have been

some sort of a satanic ritual?  

  

  

另一线索在马克思的儿子 Edgar

于1854年3月21日写给马克思的信中。此信开头就是惊人的一句“我亲爱的魔鬼”。一个儿子怎能用如此荒谬的方式称呼自己父亲？不过，撒殚教徒对他们所爱的人都是这样称呼的。难道连他儿子也入教了？  

  

Another possible hint is in a letter to Marx from his son Edgar, dated March

21, 1854. It begins with these astonishing words, "My Dear Devil." Where else

does a son greet his father in such a ridiculous way? But Satanists write so

to the ones they love. Was his son involved too?  

  

  

另一重要事实是，马克思之妻于1844年8月写信给他道：“你最后的牧师信，高级牧师兼灵魂持有者，请将和平与安宁赐予你可怜的羊群。”  

  

One more significant fact, Marx wife wrote to him in August of 1844: "Your

last pastoral letter, Higher Priest and soul Possessor, brought peace and

calmness to your poor flock."  

  

  

在《共产主义宣言》中，马克思清楚地表明他梦想消灭所有宗教。我们可以设想其中也包含了撒殚教的祭仪。马克思之妻称他为“高级牧师”，是哪个教的牧师呢？为何要给这样一名众所周知的无神论者写牧师信？这些信在哪里？马克思生命中的这个时期是尚未被探索的。  

  

Marx clearly expressed his dream concerning the elimination of all religions

in "Communist Manifesto." We should assume satanic cults were included here

too. But his wife addresses him as a Higher Priest. But of what religion? The

only faith confessed in Europe where a Higher Priest is present is Satanism.

So what kind of pastoral letters could a man write who was known as an

atheist? Where are those letters? These are periods of Marx's life that remain

unexplored.  

  

  

马克思在绝望中死去，就像所有撒殚教徒一样。他于1883年3月25日写信给恩格斯道：“生命是多么的无目标和空虚，但我多么渴望它啊！”  

  

Marx died in desperation, as all Satanists die. He wrote to Engels on March

25, 1883, "How purposeless and empty life is, but how desired!"  

  

以下英文摘自：  

  

http://www.modernhistoryproject. ... ticle=FinalWarn07-2  

  

  

卡尔·马克思生于一个富裕家庭（他父亲是律师），他的许多个人经历从未被公开。马克思学院的副主任 M. Mtchedlov 教授说，马克思的作品集有 100

卷之多，但只有 13 卷被公开印发。在马克思 6

岁时，他全家信仰了基督教。虽然马克思曾经信仰神，但在他进入Bonn和柏林大学之后，他写道，他要向上帝复仇。他加入了由 Joana Southcott

主持的撒殚教会。据说 Joana Southcott 是与恶魔 Shiloh 有联系的人。马克思早期作品中的 “Oulanem”

这个名字，是撒殚在一个祭仪中的称号。  

  

Heinrich Karl Marx (Moses Mordecai Marx Levy, 1818-83) was born of wealthy

parents (his father was a lawyer), and much of his personal life has never

been revealed. Professor M. Mtchedlov, Vice-Director of the Marx Institute,

said that there were 100 volumes in his collection, but only thirteen have

ever been reprinted for the public. When he was six, his family converted to

Christianity, and although he was once a believer in God, after attending the

Universities of Bonn and Berlin, Marx wrote that he wanted to avenge himself

"against the One who rules above." He joined the Satanist Church run by Joana

Southcott, who was said to be in contact with the demon Shiloh. His early

writings mentioned the name "Oulanem," which was a ritualistic name for Satan.

A friend of Marx wrote in 1841, that "Marx calls the Christian religion one of

the most immoral of religions." His published attacks against the German

government caused him to be ejected from the country.

可以弄个小说，来部电影嘛，类似《达芬奇的密码》《天使与魔鬼》的片子  

比如《列宾的密码》或者《马雅科夫斯基的讖讳》之类的  

用第三国际的符号来做，肯定大卖的  

  

而那个“圣杯”反正马克思也有个“夏甲”琳衡Helena Demuth的
