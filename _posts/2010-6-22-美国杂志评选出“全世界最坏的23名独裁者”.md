美国杂志评选出“全世界最坏的23名独裁者”



The Worst of the Worst  

Bad dude dictators and general coconut heads.  

  

一  

![](https://yopic.us/images/100616nkor.jpg)  

1\. KIM JONG IL of North Korea: A personality-cult-cultivating isolationist

with a taste for fine French cognac, Kim has pauperized his people, allowed

famine to run rampant, and thrown hundreds of thousands in prison camps (where

as many as 200,000 languish today) -- all while spending his country's

precious few resources on a nuclear program.  

Years in power: 16  

  

二  

![](https://yopic.us/images/100616zimb.jpg)  

2\. ROBERT MUGABE of Zimbabwe: A liberation "hero" in the struggle for

independence who has since transformed himself into a murderous despot, Mugabe

has arrested and tortured the opposition, squeezed his economy into astounding

negative growth and billion-percent inflation, and funneled off a juicy cut

for himself using currency manipulation and offshore accounts.  

Years in power: 30  

  

三  

![](https://yopic.us/images/100616myan.jpg)  

3\. THAN SHWE of Burma: A heartless military coconut head whose sole consuming

preoccupation is power, Shwe has decimated the opposition with arrests and

detentions, denied humanitarian aid to his people after 2008's devastating

Cyclone Nargis, and thrived off a black market economy of natural gas exports.

This vainglorious general bubbling with swagger sports a uniform festooned

with self-awarded medals, but he is too cowardly to face an honest ballot box.  

Years in power: 18  

  

四  

![](https://yopic.us/images/100616suda.jpg)  

4\. OMAR HASSAN AL-BASHIR of Sudan: A megalomaniac zealot who has quashed all

opposition, Bashir is responsible for the deaths of millions of Sudanese and

has been indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes. Bashir's

Arab militias, the janjaweed, may have halted their massacres in Darfur, but

they continue to traffic black Sudanese as slaves (Bashir himself has been

accused of having had several at one point).  

Years in power: 21  

  

五  

![](https://yopic.us/images/100616turk.jpg)  

5\. GURBANGULY BERDIMUHAMEDOV of Turkmenistan: Succeeding the eccentric tyrant

Saparmurat Niyazov (who even renamed the months of the year after himself and

his family), this obscure dentist has kept on keeping on with his late

predecessor's repressive policies, explaining that, after all, he bears an

"uncanny resemblance to Niyazov."  

Years in power: 4  

  

六  

![](https://yopic.us/images/100616erit.jpg)  

6\. ISAIAS AFWERKI of Eritrea: A crocodile liberator, Afwerki has turned his

country into a national prison in which independent media are shut down,

elections are categorically rejected, indefinite military service is

mandatory, and the government would rather support Somali militants than its

own people.  

Years in power: 17  

  

七  

![](https://yopic.us/images/100616uzbe.jpg)  

7\. ISLAM KARIMOV of Uzbekistan: A ruthless thug ruling since Soviet times,

Karimov has banned opposition parties, tossed as many as 6,500 political

prisoners into jail, and labels anyone who challenges him an "Islamic

terrorist." What does he do with "terrorists" once they are in his hands?

Torture them: Karimov's regime earned notoriety for boiling two people alive

and torturing many others. Outside the prisons, the president's troops are

equally indiscriminate, massacring hundreds of peaceful demonstrators in 2005

after a minor uprising in the city of Andijan.  

Years in power: 20  

  

八  

![](https://yopic.us/images/100616iran.jpg)  

8\. MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD of Iran: Inflammatory, obstinate, and a traitor to the

liberation philosophy of the Islamic Revolution, Ahmadinejad has pursued a

nuclear program in defiance of international law and the West. Responsible for

countless injustices during his five years in power, the president's latest

egregious offense was leading his paramilitary goons, the Basij, to violently

repress protesters after June 2009's disputed presidential election, which

many believe he firmly lost.  

Years in power: 5  

  

九  

![](https://yopic.us/images/100616ethi.jpg)  

9\. MELES ZENAWI of Ethiopia: Worse than the former Marxist dictator he ousted

nearly two decades ago, Zenawi has clamped down on the opposition, stifled all

dissent, and rigged elections. Like a true Marxist revolutionary, Zenawi has

stashed millions in foreign banks and acquired mansions in Maryland and London

in his wife's name, according to the opposition -- even as his barbaric regime

collects a whopping $1 billion in foreign aid each year.  

Years in power: 19  

  

十  

![](https://yopic.us/images/100616chin.jpg)  

10\. HU JINTAO of China: A chameleon despot who beguiles foreign investors

with a smile and a bow, but ferociously crushes political dissent with brutal

abandon, Hu has an iron grip on Tibet and is now seeking what can only be

described as new colonies in Africa from which to extract the natural

resources his growing economy craves.  

Years in power: 7  

  

十一  

![](https://yopic.us/images/100616liby.jpg)  

11\. MUAMMAR AL-QADDAFI of Libya: An eccentric egoist infamous for his

indecipherably flamboyant speeches and equally erratic politics, Qaddafi runs

a police state based on his version of Mao's Red Book -- the Green Book --

which includes a solution to "the Problem of Democracy." Repressive at home,

Qaddafi masquerades as Africa's king of kings abroad (the African Union had to

politely insist that he step down as its rotating head).  

Years in power: 41  

  

十二  

![](https://yopic.us/images/100616syri.jpg)  

12\. BASHAR AL-ASSAD of Syria: A pretentious despot trying to fit into his

father's shoes (they're too big for him), Assad has squandered billions on

foreign misadventures in such places as Lebanon and Iraq while neglecting the

needs of the Syrian people. His extensive security apparatus ensures that the

population doesn't complain.  

Years in power: 10  

  

十三  

![](https://yopic.us/images/100616chad.jpg)  

13\. IDRISS DÉBY of Chad: Having led a rebel insurgency against a former

dictator, Déby today faces a similar challenge -- from one of his own former

cabinet officials, among others. To repel would-be coup leaders, Déby has

drained social spending accounts to equip the military, co-opted opposition-

leader foes, and is now building a moat around the capital, N'Djamena.  

Years in power: 20

「全球23名最腐朽独裁者」金正日名列榜首



From RTHK news  

2010-06-22 HKT 17:52  

  

美国《外交政策》杂志选出「全球23名最腐朽独裁者」，北韩领袖金正日名列榜首。  

  

这本杂志说，金正日秉承个人崇拜思想，执政16年期间，将宝贵的国家资源全部投入核子计划，人民饱受饥饿贫困之苦。  

  

津巴布韦总统穆加比，在「腐朽独裁者」榜上排第二，他执政长达30年，从独立斗争英雄变成令人厌恶的独裁者，逮捕和拷打在野党人士，同时令国家经济陷入长期衰退。

我认为,今日之天朝已经从毛太祖时代的"一人独裁",演变成"集体独裁".  

在美国,最高法院的九位大法官起着举足轻重的作用.  

在中国,同样有九个人,起着更加举足轻重的作用.政治局常委.

14\. TEODORO OBIANG NGUEMA MBASOGO of Equatorial Guinea: Obiang and his family

literally own the economy, having reportedly amassed a fortune exceeding $600

million while the masses are left in desperate poverty. Equatorial Guinea's

extraordinary oil wealth puts its GDP per capita on par with many European

states -- if only it were evenly shared. Instead, revenues remain a "state

secret."

preoccupation is self-perpetuation in office, Mubarak is suspicious of even

his own shadow. He keeps a 30-year-old emergency law in place to squelch any

opposition activity and has groomed his son, Gamal, to succeed him. (No wonder

only 23 percent of Egyptians bothered to vote in the 2005 presidential

election.)

over Uganda in 1986, Museveni declared: "No African head of state should be in

power for more than 10 years." But 24 years later, he is still here, winning

one "coconut election" after another in which other political parties are

technically legal but a political rally of more than a handful of people is

not.

security forces, the civil service, the judiciary, banks, universities, and

state-owned corporations. Those who challenge the president are accused of

being a hatemonger or divisionist and arrested.

which he then uses to justify even more brutal clampdowns.

brutal style of governance has earned him the title "Europe's last dictator";

he even gave safe haven to Kyrgyzstan's toppled leader when that country rose

up this spring.

23\. PAUL BIYA of Cameroon: A suave bandit who has reportedly amassed a

personal fortune of more than $200 million and the mansions to go with it,

Biya has co-opted the opposition into complete submission. Not that he's

worried about elections; he has rigged the term limit laws twice to make sure

the party doesn't end anytime soon.  

Years in power: 28

这个评比的是个人吧?  

胡的独裁不完全是个人独裁.更像是一个团体的独裁.  

比起金家的个人独裁.确实逊了一个档次.

全球最腐朽独裁者评选 金正日再居首



美国《外交政策杂志》日前评出2010年“23名全球最腐朽独裁者”，其中北韩最高领导人金正日名列榜首。紧接其后的是，津巴布韦总统穆加贝、缅甸最高军事将领丹瑞上将、苏丹总统巴希尔等。  

  

据韩联社22日报导，美国《外交政策杂志》日前评出今年23名全球最腐朽独裁者中，金正日名列榜首。该杂志称，金正日是一名秉承个人崇拜思想的孤立主义者，在16年的执政期间，将宝贵的国家资源全部投入在核项目开发方面，让人民饱受饥饿和贫困之苦。同时将近20万名居民送到政治收容所等。  

  

早在2008年9月，英国《泰晤士报》网络版评选出“十大最腐朽独裁者”，金正日便居首位。美国《华盛顿邮报》发行的周末副刊杂志《大观（PARADE）》在2009年“世界十大独裁者”

评选中，金正日降至第三，津巴布韦总统穆加贝排在首位。  

  

据《泰晤士报》网络版报导，金正日在俄罗斯进行国事访问时，还每天空运活龙虾供自己享用。报导披露金正日拥有17座宫殿、数百辆汽车和两万本录像带。他有一支由年轻貌美的女性组成的“欢乐队(Pleasure

Brigade)”，每年花费65万美元购买高级洋酒轩尼诗VSOP干邑。  

  

据金正日原来的一位警卫说，金正日生活腐化，周围总有美女陪伴，而且喜欢喝酒。这位姓李的叛逃者曾担任过金正日11年的保镖。他在接受《时代周刊》的采访时，透露了很多金正日鲜为人知的生活细节。据他说，金正日在北韩首都平壤有两处宫邸，在平壤以外的八个省也分别有自己的行宫。他的宫邸里配备有酒吧、卡拉OK、小型电影院，和巨大的游泳池。  

  

金正日不论走到哪里，身边总有一名漂亮的护士和一个女医生陪伴。这位姓李的警卫曾被安排在北韩东海岸金正日的海边别墅保护他的安全。他说：“金正日的随身医护人员一定要聪明漂亮，谈吐诙谐，要能让金正日开心，随身医生和护士都很年轻，所以不一定是医务人员”。  

  

去年获得诺贝尔文学奖的德国作家赫塔．穆勒不久前在接受韩国文艺季刊《文学村》的采访时说：“北韩的恐怖、贫穷的规模和状态让人无法想像。感觉无异于大型收容所。”

穆勒痛批北韩称：“北韩已告别历史与文明。”  

  

前北韩劳动党秘书长黄长烨，是北韩叛逃的最高级别的官员。他曾经是金正日的父亲金日成的心腹，也是金正日的导师，负责他的教育。黄长烨对金正日的评价是：“金正日是一个冷酷无情的人，为紧紧抓住权力会不惜一切代价。”  

  

黄长烨还认为，美国和北韩在1994

年达成的框架协议是一个错误，因为只要美国继续向北韩提供经济援助，金正日就会把援助用来制造更多的导弹和核武器，因为他绝对不是愿意和平相处的那种人。
