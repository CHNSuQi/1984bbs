Remembering Tiananmen, 20 years later  

Yesterday, June 4th, 2009, marked the 20th anniversary of the military

crackdown on student protesters gathered in Tiananmen Square in Beijing,

China. Beginning in April of 1989, thousands of students and other citizens

started gathering in groups large and small, protesting many issues, centered

on a desire for freedom and democratic reform. By mid-May of 1989, hundreds of

thousands of protesters occupied the square, staging hunger strikes, and

asking for dialogue. Chinese authorities responded with a declaration of

martial law, and sent soldiers and tanks from the People's Liberation Army,

preparing to disperse the crowds. Late on June 3rd, 1989, the tanks and

armored personnel carriers rolled into the square, killing and wounding many,

mostly civilians - estimates vary widely, from several hundred to several

thousand dead. The first 17 photos below were taken in 1989, the rest are from

this year, as people remember the events, the ideals, and the fallout from

that fateful day. (32 photos total)

This file photo taken twenty years ago on June 2, 1989 shows some of the

hundreds of thousands of Chinese gathering around a 10-meter replica of the

Statue of Liberty (center), called the Goddess of Democracy, in Tiananmen

Square demanding democracy despite martial law in Beijing. Hundreds, possibly

thousands, of protesters were killed by China's military on June 3 and 4,

1989, as communist leaders ordered an end to six weeks of unprecedented

democracy protests in the heart of the Chinese capital. (CATHERINE
