Cars、AV大久保、怪力与Birdstriking再次高唱青年中国之声。  

  

Carsick

Cars与P.K.14、小河完美的完成了首次美国巡演之后，将再次与这两队伟大的艺术家继续美国之旅，这次他们的目的地是奥斯丁的西南西音乐节和整个西海岸，同行的还有Snapline、White和AV大久保；AV大久保2007年被巡演路上的李维思发掘并首次邀请到D-22之后，迅速成为中国新音乐场景中不可获缺的一部分，而如同前辈SMZB一样坚持本土化的操守则使他们赢得了更多赞誉；同样有武汉血统的怪力则用大江南北的五味陈杂提炼出了怪异却和谐的左朋克，与台上的强大气场相得益章的是他们一直身体力行的走南闯北——在后No

Beijing的众多乐队中，他们是唯一坚持至今的；新军Birdstriking用简单有力的噪音墙与青涩的中文唱腔相结合，构造出了更年轻的属于1990年后年轻人的青春号角。  

  

2月26日，虎年大年十三，杭州新场地，酷电空间，兵马司与KAKOUSHI共同呈现。

■Carsick Cars  

Carsick

Cars由主唱和吉他手守望（24岁），鼓手李青（26岁），以及贝司手李维思（25岁）组成。乐队成立于2005年的3月，当时还是北京理工大学学生的守望在一个朋友的排练室里遇见了李维思和李青。5月时他们在一次小型的朋友聚会上做了他们的第一次演出，在那一年的年底，他们开始在北京的俱乐部里表演。他们第一张专辑录制于2007年的春天，由

P.K.14乐队的主唱杨海崧制作。  

  

他们的声音，受到了Velvet Underground，Suicide和Sonic Youth的影响，同时也拥有Steve Reich和Glenn

Branca的质地和结构，混合着粗糙的咆哮和强硬的开放和弦，这使得他们优美的歌曲呈现出一种探索性以及破碎感。在爆炸性的噪音和回授中，这些歌曲在某些瞬间透露出它们是多么地优秀，而这在许多北京的音乐家的身上也有所反映，许多音乐家也已经成为他们的歌迷——Carsick

Cars的歌曲也许是中国地下乐队中被其他乐队翻唱最频繁的。  

  

作为受到全世界瞩目的中国地下乐队中的一支，Carsick Cars已经在中国和国外做了大量的演出。他们去过中国的各大城市的俱乐部，并在

2007年的8月和9月，Sonic Youth——他们将Carsick

Cars称作他们最喜爱的中国乐队——邀请他们一起进行欧洲巡演。在他们伦敦的演出之后，Carsick

Cars受到邀请参加2007年10月奥地利的Steirischer Herbst音乐节，以及2008年五月伦敦的All Tomorrow’s

Parties音乐节，并成为Dinosaur

Jr.专场表演嘉宾。随着海外歌迷群的不断聚集，乐队已经跻身世界优秀乐队的行列，2009年5月被邀请参加欧洲音乐盛会之一的巴塞罗那Primavera

Sound‘09音乐节，9月与Joyside横跨欧罗巴巡演并在之后与P.K.14，小河进行了首次美国巡演，所到之处无不令美国乐迷疯狂。回到中国后，乐队应邀参加了星空卫视海外部强档专栏Asian

Uncut的圣诞特别节目录制，并以音乐嘉宾的身份在节目的最后环节表演了《Dear

Friend》和《中南海》两首歌曲。而在2010年2月，乐队将首次踏上韩国的土地，与Maybe Noise旗下的10进行小规模巡演。  

  

伴随着乐队一起，Carsick

Cars乐队的成员们在许多其他的音乐计划中也非常的积极。守望是实验组合White乐队的创始成员之一，他们的第一张专辑由Einsturzende

Neubaten乐队的领导者Blixa Bargeld2007年5月在柏林制作完成。2006年的2月他作为乐手参与录制了Glenn

Branca的《Symphony 13》，并且与作曲家Elliott Sharp和Alvin

Curran一起多次合作演出。2007年7月在纽约的一个音乐节上的表演后，他被邀请参加他们的第二张专辑的录音。李青和李维思是三人乐队Snapline的创始成员，他们的第一张专辑由PiL的鼓手Martin

Atkins制作，并将在他的Invisible Records发行。此外李青也参与过Elliott Sharp的演出。  

  

乐队已经被中国，英国，德国，瑞典，法国以及美国等国家的媒体广泛地报道过，并且出现在美国，德国，澳大利亚和新西兰的电视节目中。2007年9月他们被《That’s

Beijing》列为中国最优秀的乐队之一，而 2008年9月，《音乐时空》中一篇文章将守望列为中国10位青年杰出吉他手之一。2009年底，新专辑《You

Can Listen,You Can Talk》被华盛顿邮报评为本年十大专辑之一。

■AV大久保  

1998年香港。鬼才导演葛民辉把厚积了一系列的实验，悬念以及失败产物整合《初缠恋后的二人世界》出版。其中一部《AV大久保》讲述了一个名为大久保的日本黑社会，前往香港寻找昔日恋人的故事。当片中这个一直等待爱人的男人奔跑在九龙夜幕下，“AV大久保”几个字跃然屏幕——武汉乐队“AV大久保”的名字便来自于此：浪漫、有趣、怪。AV大久保乐队的武汉B级摇滚让我们体验到更多的是幼年时弥散在周围却或许并不明白的娱乐气氛。这种娱乐不像当年迪斯科舞厅和小剧场里的单纯聒噪，它被时代所连带出客观的视角和嘲弄的口吻。  

  

AV大久保乐队在2006年组于武汉，成员包括：主唱/键盘：陆炎；吉他：谭超；贝司：左翼；鼓手：胡鹃。06年9月乐队在武汉先后两次为SMZB演出暖场，特别是改编自SMZB的“Where's

My

Vote”的雷鬼版本得到了台下观众热烈反响，效果极佳。从2007年起，乐队排练频率增大，演出次数也增加，先后担了：Orange（乌拉圭英伦乐队），The

Last Chance of Youth（北京独立硬核乐队），The 4 Sivits

（德国硬核乐队），Ratata（纽约电音摇滚乐队），Battles（纽约摇滚乐队）的特邀演出嘉宾。在2008年的摩登天空音乐节，AV大久保更是表现不俗，掀起全场火爆气氛。2008年10月，乐队与金牌制作人Martin

Atkins在亚洲最大的录音棚A-String录制了他们的首张专辑《大时代》。  

  

对于AV大久保来说，音乐就是去过了哪些地方，经历了什么以及经历了谁。纷呈色彩糅杂在一起：新浪潮、实验噪音、朋克舞曲……任何看过他们演出的人都不能给出准确的风格定义；每一次演出，每一首歌，每次的亮相，乐队都是给人耳目一新的感觉，不拘泥于形式却又形式感十足，复杂编曲，简单直白的歌词，以及实验性的突破。Break

Wave就是AV大久保自己对曲风的描述。乐队有一首歌曲的歌词只有一个字：破。为达到最佳效果，陆炎在演唱这首歌时，双手交叉，嘴里连发爆破音“破、破、破”，看得台下连连叫绝。  

  

AV大久保在全民娱乐时代横贯出世。它既不同于一针见血的朋克批判，也不等于对时事世事的全盘否定——它会质疑和锐化其中的漏洞，然后用实力说话，以求改变它。

■怪力  

怪力乐队在音乐上可以算得上是个异类，五位性格迥异的成员恰到好处的将各自特点融合到了乐队的音乐当中。四位乐手各自为政的演奏巧妙地左冲右突，音乐中充满了无限可能性的变化，主唱文隽则利用她独特的嗓音和及具感染力和爆发力的演唱将整个音乐纳入到“怪力”的范畴以内。  

  

乐队刚刚完成了他们的第一张录音室专辑前期录音工作， 专辑音乐风格以PUNK为基调 融合了blues，no wave，post

punk，hardcore，white noise等多种元素。通过丰富的音乐手段结合歌词内容，

表达出乐队成员一贯的思想内核，以独特的思考体系探索于各种存在或可能存在的事物之中，妄游以记之。  

  

乐队在与老牌音乐人方无行的合作过程中发生地化学反应，使得乐队对于音色的把握能力日趋成熟，现场也更具表现力 。

■Birdstriking  

大家都忙着收拾行装准备新学期的开始时，一个崭新的乐队Birdstriking(鸟撞飞机）在北京这个堪称最适合文艺青年的的城市诞生了，乐队成立于

2009年3月。乐队成员分别是何凡(guitar&vocal)、杨帆(bass)、王欣九(drum)，这三个大学新生拿起各自的乐器认认真真地为了自己的青春革命写起歌来，幸好他们不是文艺青年，这个世界上该死的小清新已经够多了。  

  

乐队成立仅仅两个月，就被人称为继Carsick

Cars后最有前途的新星，不止如此，经过在D-22和各大音乐节的数次现场演出后，他们竟然引来了CNN的跨洋关注，是什么让这个年轻的乐队得到了其他人梦寐以求的机会？如果你看过他们的现场，读过他们的歌词，和他们一起度过一个不眠之夜，那么这个问题就不需要问了。Birdstriking用暴躁热血的台风、对这个时代和国家充满思考，隐喻和呐喊的歌词，以及粗砾而真实的音乐——就象那些你所了解的90年代初美国地下乐队，在北京的新乐队中独树一帜。冲动？反抗？理想？撞飞机为什么会有巨大的破坏力？

因为高速运动，时速80公里，产生21.6万牛顿的力。  

  

现在，你有一个机会冲向飞机，用你年轻的身体挑战看似坚不可摧的机器。击落它，粉碎它，让碎片毁灭统治者的美梦？是选择日复一日的重复生活、浪费青春、被洗脑…或是去看一场演出，坐上一架注定会被一万只喜鹊（你们自己）撞毁的飞机，尝试一次真正的飞行，第二天醒来，就是一个全新的自己。

Maybe Mars is delighted to present Independent China In Stereo from Carsick

Cars, AV Okubo, Guai Li and Birdstriking to you on the 26th of Feburary,

another striking event since the Arabesque No.1 on January 23rd, brought out

in collaboration with fellow organizer KAKOUSHI.  

  

Carsick Cars will tour with P.K.14 and XiaoHe again after the first US tour,

this time along with Snapline, White and AV Okubo, their destinations expands

from SXSW Festival to the entire West Coast. AV Okubo became part of the new

Chinese music scene since their debut in D-22 in 2007 after being discovered

by Li Weisi during Carsick Cars mainland tour, they strive for persistence of

their origins as senior musicians SMZB did, which has earned themselves enough

credits; Hailed from Wuhan, Guai Li mixed many of the nation’s local cultures

with which they reinvented a kind of punk music brimming with weirdness and

harmony as well,they called it Left Punk. The force emerging from their

powerful act on stagel benefit from their lively travelling experiences around

this country, leaving them the only band that remains to have such strength in

waves of acts from post No Beijing era; Birdstriking, unlike most of the

mentioned bands, is a group of youngsters who pictured and echoed people from

the 1990s, playing a trumpet of green days with a mixture of guitar noise and

not-yet-matured Chinese singing.  

  

The show will start fresh in Code Place, a new venue in Hangzhou, two days

before the traditional Lantern Festival.

Carsick Cars  

http://www.myspace.cn/107308764  

Carsick Cars is a Beijing-based band formed in March 2005 by vocal/guitarist

Shouwang (aka Jeff), drummer Li Qing, and bassist Li Weisi, when the three

were university students at the Beijing Institute of Technology. Shouwang met

the other two members at a friend’s rehearsal space, hit it off very quickly

when they found that they loved and were influenced by the same music, and in

May performed their debut show at a friend’s party. Almost

immediately,knowledgeable people began talking about the band, and although in

the beginning they had trouble getting shows at the main clubs in Beijing

because of their abrasive guitar sounds and the low-key intensity of their

performances they began a series of performance in smaller clubs and rehearsal

spaces around the city. In 2006 they teamed together with three other young

bands equally disillusioned with the Beijing music scene to form No Beijing.

This was the catalyst that caused them suddenly to receive a great deal of

attention and they found themselves playing larger clubs and even touring

around the country.  

  

Their debut album was recorded in spring of 2007, produced by P.K.14 vocalist

Yang Haisong, who has remained a friend, adviser, inspiration and sometimes

sound man to the band ever since. Their second album was produced in October

2008 by legendary New York producer Wharton Tiers, whose credits include Sonic

Youth, Dinosaur Jr., Swans, and Helmet, among many others.  

  

The band is highly influenced by The Velvet Underground, Suicide and Sonic

Youth, was well as by the repetitive structures and harmonic developments of

Steve Reich and Glenn Branca. Like many of China’s best musicians they create

elegantly-constructed melodies and are fascinated with the textures of

different sounds and ways of combing them. Their music mixes rough abrasive

shrieks and harsh,even outrageous, chords with delicate guitar lines that have

an almost shimmering lightness. The exploding noise and feedback that weaves

through their music inspired one of the Beijing underground’s earliest

graffiti tags “Jeff loves noise.” Almost from the start Carsick Cars has

received enthusiastic responses from fellow local artists and they are

especially loved by Beijing’s growing hordes of sophisticated young musicians,

making them the Chinese underground band whose songs are most frequently

covered by other bands.  

  

As their reputation spread, they began touring actively around the world, in

China with the likes of These Are Powers, Ex-Models, and Yann Tiersen. In the

summer of 2007 they were asked by Sonic Youth to open for them during their

European tour, and have since maintained a close relationship with the band.

At the London end of their tour the band was invited to Steirischer Herbst

Festival in Austria. The following May they played London’s All Tomorrow’s

Parties Festival,opening for Dinosaur Jr. After several more European shows

the band returned to China for a 20-city tour with label mates Gar before

returning to Europe for a series of shows in England, Switzerland and Spain.

The tour culminated in a 7 p.m. slot at Barcelona’s Primavera Sound Festival,

one Europe’s largest festivals. The band is currently preparing an October

tour in Europe with label mates Joyside before joining five other Maybe Mars

acts for a series of widely anticipated shows in New York (four separate

performances) followed by an East Coast tour of the United States.Returning to

the country, the band went on filming the Christmas Special session for Asian

Uncut as guest musicians on this hit program of Star TV International. In

Feburary 2010, Carsick Cars will make their debut appearance in Korea with

another Maybe Mars lable mates 10, on a small-scale tour.  

  

Beside Carsick Cars, the three members are also heavily involved in other

music projects. Shouwang, for one, is also one of two members of“White”, one

of China’s most admired experimental bands, and whose first album was produced

in May 2007, by Einsturzende Neubaten frontman Blixa Bargeld in Berlin. The

year before, in February, he also participated in Glenn Branca’s “Symphony

13”, and has since then collaborated several times with composers Elliott

Sharp, Alvin Curran,Christian Marclay and John Myers. His chamber orchestra

piece“Xizhimen Traffic Lights” was performed by the Beijing New Music ensemble

and broadcast by the BBC in 2008. Li Qing and Li Weisi found“Snapline”, as

guitarist and bassist respectively, along with vocalist Chen Xi. Snapline’s

debut album was produced by Martin Atkins,drummer of PiL and Killing Joke, and

the album was released on his own label, Invisible Records. Li Qing, who has

also collaborated with Elliott Sharp, formed a second band with Li Weisi in

2009, called Soviet Pop.  

  

Carsick Cars has been widely covered by the press, including leading

newspapers and magazines from China, UK, Germany, Sweden, France,Brazil and

the US. They have been featured in TV appearances on CNN,the BBC, and local

stations in the US, Germany, Australia and New Zealand. In September 2008,

Shouwang was ranked among the “Top ten young guitarists in China” by “INMUSIC”

magazine.At end of 2009,"You Can Listen,You Can Talk"chosen as 1 of the top 10

albums of year by Washington Post.  

  

  

AV Okubo  

http://www.douban.com/artist/avokubo/  

Hong Kong experimental cinema, 80’s Kungfu movies, gangsters, cartoons, Qian

Xuesen and China’s early space program all combine in AV Okubo’s sound to

create an idea of B-Rock; “romantic, funny, odd.” The combination of retro-

amusements combined with deeper social critique has quickly brought this young

band to the attention of fellow musicians and audiences across China.  

  

Formed in 2006 in the industrial megalopolis of Wuhan, AV Okubo has captured

the eyes and ears of China with the members themselves living out their

music’s conflicts of a changing society. Frontman Lu Yan (vox / keyboard) is

an aspiring film director while Tan Chao (guitar) works a day job as a train

engineer in a major steel factory. Filling out the band Zuo Yi (bass) and Hu

Juan (percussion) are both active in the local music scene. AV Okubo has

become south China’s go to act for foreign touring bands. They have played

with, and at times overshadowed, such bands as Orange (Uruguay), The 4 Sivits

(Germany), Ratatat (USA), These Are Powers (USA) and Battles (USA). Several

large festival appearances, including 2008’s Modern Sky Festival and 2009’s

JUE Festival, have exposed them to larger audience and their infrequent trips

to the capital have become occasions for packed and crazy shows attended by

eager fans. In late 2008 the band set up in A-String, Asia’s largest studio,

to record their debut album with acclaimed producer Martin Atkins.  

  

For the band, music is places they've been to, people they’ve met and things

they've experienced. New wave, experimental noise, disco punk; ultimately

their sound emerges as a mosaic with varied elements. AV Okubo has grown up in

the entertainment era. Neither being punky criticism, nor a complete overthrow

--they slide through a loophole and make a change.  

  

  

Guaili  

http://www.myspace.cn/guailiguaili  

Guaili are musical freaks, five musicians with different tastes in music came

up together and mixed each one’s musical influence into one genre in a unique

way.  

  

Guaili just finished the pre-production of their debut studio album. This

album is based on the root of punk, but meanwhile some other elements such as

blues, no wave, post punk, hardcore, white noise are also involved, behind the

complex musical arrangement there is their lyrics reflected Guaili’s deep

thought.  

  

During the recording of their debut album “Wang You Ji” with famous Taiwanese

rock producer Fang Wuxing, Guaili achieved a brand new level and musically

also became more mature.  

  

  

Birdstriking  

http://www.douban.com/artist/birdstriking/  

when everyone was busy preparing their packages for the start of new

semester,a brand new band which is called birdstrking had emerged in beijing

-----the so called "best suited young culture lover"city---in march,2009.The

participants are Hefan(guitar&vocal).Yangfan(  

bass),wangxinjiu(drum),these three fresh man began to write their youth

revolutionary in a very sincerely and seriously way.It's lucky that they are

not some kind of campy youth again,cause we all had quite enough of those damn

boring indie music.  

  

they were named the most promising star after csc only after their

establishment in 2 months.much more than that,they had even attracted cnn's

concern across the ocean after several live performances in the D-22 and some

major music festivals .so,what makes the young band get the opportunity that

every other band wants so badly?the question wouldn't be asked if you have

once watched their live performances, read their lyrics or spent a sleepless

night with them  

  

....birdstrking had started a trend among beijing's new bands by using the

bloody and choleric style of performance;the lyrics which is full of

thoughtful,metaphor and shouting,and also the tough but real music----------

just like those American under ground bands of early 90's that u know well.  

  

Impulse?Resistance?Vision?Why the aircraft has the destructive force?Because

high-speed movement, speed of 80 km, resulting in 216,000 Newton's force。  

  

now,you have a chance to rush towards the aircraft ,challenging the seemingly

indestructible machine with your young body.down it,crush it,so those debris

destroyed the dreams of rulers?either to choose to repeat daily life,waste

youth,be brainwashed, or go to watch another show ,sit on a destined crashed

airplane by 10000 magpies,try a real fly,and weak up to be a new self.
