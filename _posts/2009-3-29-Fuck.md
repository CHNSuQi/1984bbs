Prime mister, I see you already master the essential craft of the European

politician, name the ability to say one thing in this chamber and very

different thing in your home elected (electried?). You spoke here about free

trade…who would have guessed listening to you just now you would author of the

phrase British jobs for british workers, and you would have subsidize the way

you have nationized outright ….our economy including car industry and many of

banks.  

Perhaps you would have more moral authority in this house, if your actions

matched your words. Perhaps you had more legitimacy in the council of the

world(?), if United Kingdom would not go into this recession in the worst

condition of any G20 country.  

The truth, Prime minister, is that you have run out of our money. The country

as a whole is now in negative equity. Every British child is born owing around

24000 pounds. Servicing that interest of that debt would cost more than

educating the child.  

Now once again today, you try to spread the blame around. you spoke about

international recession, international crisis. Well, it is true that we are

all sailing together into the (skulls??). But not every vessel in the convey

is in the same dilapidated condition. Other ships used good years to coat

their hull and clear their (rigging??). Another words to pay off debt. But you

used good years to raise borrowing yet further. As a consequence and your

captaincy our hull is pressed deep in the water line under the accumulated

weight of your debt. We are running the deficit the touch of 10% of GDP, an

almost unbelievable figure.  More than Pakistan, more than hungry. Country of

IMF has been called in.  

Now, it’s not about you are not apologizing, like everybody else and I has

learn the accept of you pathologically incapable of accepting the

responsibility for these thing. It is your carrying on with willfully

worsening our situation, wantonly spending what little we have left.  

Last year and last 12 months, a hundred thousand private sector jobs have been

lost, and yet you created 30 thousand public jobs. Prime minister, you can not

carry on forever. Squeezing the productive bit of economy in order to fund an

unprecedented engorgement of unprodictive bit. You cannot spend your way out

of recession, or borrow your way out of debt. and when you repeat in that

(woodened …??) way,  That our situation better than others, well placed to

weather the storm, I have to tell you, you sound like (*^%^%^^*&^*&%*) give

the party line.  

You know and we know and you know that we know it is nonsense. Everyone knows

that Britain is worse than any other country as we go through this hard times.

The IMF had said so, the European commission had said so, The market had said

so which is why our currency had devalued by 30%, and soon the voters too

would get their chance to say so. They can see what market already see that

you are devalued prime Minister of devalued government.
