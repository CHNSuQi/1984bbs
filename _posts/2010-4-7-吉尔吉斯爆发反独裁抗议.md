吉尔吉斯斯坦总理称骚乱由破坏分子精心策划



吉尔吉斯斯坦总理称骚乱由破坏分子精心策划(图)

4月6日，吉尔吉斯斯坦总理乌谢诺夫在首都比什凯克举行的记者招待会上回答记者提问。新华社记者沙达提/摄  

  

新华网比什凯克4月7日电（记者沙达提）吉尔吉斯斯坦总理乌谢诺夫7日在总统府告诉新华社记者，6日发生在塔拉斯市的骚乱是破坏分子精心策划的。  

  

乌谢诺夫说，6日晚在塔拉斯有5辆“卡玛斯”大货车向反对派示威者运送鹅卵石，还有2辆车运送纵火用的汽油。大部分示威者手持钢管和棍棒。在骚乱中，15名警察失踪，他们可能被反对派示威者抓为人质，也可能在围攻中逃脱了。  

  

乌谢诺夫说，7日凌晨示威者多次试图占领塔拉斯内务局大楼，以解救被拘禁的反对派人士并夺取枪械，但未能成功。目前，示威者手里有一些卡拉什尼科夫冲锋枪和猎枪，以及从警察手中抢走的2支枪。  

  

  

吉尔吉斯斯坦总检察长图尔松库洛夫说，根据线报，在塔拉斯市的反对派示威者每人获得了12美元到60美元不等的奖金。这证明该市的骚乱是精心策划、妄图暴力推翻政府的行动。  

  

吉紧急情况部长托罗巴耶夫当天说，6日晚塔拉斯州政府大楼被反对派示威者部分焚烧，2辆消防车在赶去灭火的路上被示威者拦截围攻，车上12名消防员均被打伤。消防员在防暴警察赶到后被解救出来，继续驱车到州政府大楼完成了灭火工作。  

  

据吉媒体报道，这一事件的导火索是反对派领导人舍尔尼亚佐夫被警方拘留，引起反对派支持者不满。

吉国发生暴乱，苏帝呼吁和解



中新网4月7日电

综合媒体报道，7日，由于数千名民众在吉尔吉斯斯坦首都比什凯克市中心集结并与警方发生冲突，吉总理乌谢诺夫宣布在全国范围内实行紧急状态，并实施宵禁。  

  

据报道，7日，数千名反对派示威者走上街头游行，要求总统巴基耶夫辞职，并试图占领多处政府机关大楼。当局派出警察维护秩序，警方与示威民众发生激烈冲突，新华网消息称，冲突导致10人丧生。  

  

另有约100人受伤。  

  

据法新社报道，电视画面显示，吉尔吉斯斯坦总理乌谢诺夫在议会上发表讲话，并宣布在吉全国实行紧急状态。他说，“在紧急状态下，必须在全国实行宵禁”。  

  

而俄罗斯方面做出表态，呼吁吉尔吉斯斯坦政府与反对派不要用暴力对抗，而是在法律框架内解决问题。  

  

据国际文传电讯社报道，俄罗斯副外长卡拉辛(Grigory

Karasin)表示，“我们一贯的立场是，吉尔吉斯斯坦存在的所有政治、经济以及社会方面的意见分歧都应该在民主程序的框架之内来解决”。他说，应避免流血事件的发生。  

  

俄新网则称，俄罗斯外交部发言人安德烈·涅斯捷连科表示，俄方呼吁吉尔吉斯斯坦的集会者与执政当局放弃使用暴力。  

  

涅斯捷连科说：“吉尔吉斯斯坦近日发生反对派支持者与护法人员的冲突，我们密切关注事态的发展。从维护我们友好国家政治稳定的角度出发，我们认为，在目前局势中应在法制基础上解决所有问题，这一点很重要。”  

  

他进一步指出：“同时我们想呼吁对抗双方放弃使用暴力，以在任何情况下避免流血。”

Crisis in Kyrgyzstan  

Widespread anti-government protests in Kyrgyzstan recently turned violent,

with groups of opposition protesters attempting to storm some government

buildings, and clashing with riot police. Tensions are high, as Kyrgyz

authorities declared a national state of emergency, and are enforcing curfews

in at least three cities. As riot police fired on opposition members and

protesters fought with stones and captured weapons, estimates of casualties

have varied widely, with reports ranging from 12 killed to over 100 killed.

Opposition leaders appear to have taken over some of the national television

channels, and President Kurmanbek Bakiyev appears to have fled the capital,

Bishkek overnight. As the situation in Kyrgyzstan remains in flux, I may post

more photos here later, as warranted. (38 photos total)

History is repeating itself yet again. Suppression of freedom of expression

has always led to protests, demonstrations and then deaths. This is elementary

math. A head of state should be smart enough to anticipate this. Unless of

course, he anticipated this and went ahead with the media shutdown anyway –

which makes him responsible for these riots.

All of you should know that this is the second revolt in that poor country

that ends with government crash and change of ruling party. The current

president of Kyrgyzstan was the leader of the previous revolt, and those who

now lead the riots against him were his allies. The only difference so far is

that this time they didn't even need elections to start the revolt.  

Last time nothing changed in that country. Even the slogans against corruption

remain the same.  

There is no chance this revolt is going to change anything. The heads in the

policemen shoot at people, when they were supposed to protect them. Power

corrupts, another case proved it.

Kyrgyzstan need serious anti-corruption laws if there is to be any hope in the

future - and to enforce them strictly.  

  

Relatives and spouses of cabinet members shouldn't be allowed to have any deal

with the state (concessions, sales etc), and they shouldn't be allowed to be

in charge in any public office as long as the cabinet member is in charge.

country,for their kids future,for a better life and some of you guys are from

Russia-what about your country? breathing quietly and keep surviving...but

Kyrgyz people are warriors and always been,read the history before saying

perfect breed between white and asian-kyrgyz people are mixed with perfect

mixed-Turkic and Mongolian!  

And before laugh and make fun of these people on the picture,think about what

i can't believe some of the more joking comments on here. this is a real

situation involving real people. this is their life, one that in some cases

(as the photos graphically indicate) are being extinguished.  

  

while i'm too far detached geographically to comment on the politics, i

empathize with the protesters who have died fighting for improved living

conditions. i also empathize with those police officers who are being killed

and tortured for doing their job.

I lived in Bishkek for two years. This is the next chapter in the Tulip

Revolution of 2005. People are protesting because of rampant corruption in the

government and because fuel and commodity prices have shot up, making it hard

for people just to get by. A complicating factor is the number of guns on the

street: many bought guns after the 2005 revolution because they were afraid

that the looting that happened then would happen again. Well, it's happening

again and now the police and army are firing on the people as well. So, so

sad.  

  

Local news is reporting that the prime minister has stepped down and that Rosa

Otumbaeva has become the new leader. President Bakiyev has apparently fled the

country. Hopefully the worst of the violence is over and no more people will

be killed.

Sorry for my english, I have nor practice more then 3 years. I'm from Bishkek,

That's not coming of democracy as it called by protestors. It's just crime

actions. Most of protestors are no educated, no employed people, who wants to

rob some supermarkets as it was 5 years ago, when happened copu d'etat. And it

happens right now, most bussinesmen five years ago became bunkrupt, but the

government said that it would never happen again. But it happens and commiters

of crime are "new government", which doesn't do anything right now. Policemens

will not go to raid the streets of Bishkek, because there is no any orders

from new government. Bussinesmen are trying to save their supermarkets, but

protestors are armed and dangerous. Today protestors took two ministers as

hostages. They beat them, may be one of them already dead. I sympathize with

my people in our sorrow but now I decide to get out of my country in any way,

because that drunk and crazy mob will appear before government's house every

5-6 years. Presidents and other politics will continue to steal budget money,

there never will be a beatufil and peacfull state of Kyrgyzstan.

(even though she is living far from the center of the city where all of this

happening). My nice (10 years old) has only 1 class today after what the

principal let the school close. Therefore parents came and pick up the

children. It is not possible to do it by public transportation therefore some

has to come by cars. She mentioned that the car one of her friend that lives

close to the city center has been stooped on the way back from school by the

crowd and all the passengers were taken out (including children) and the car

has been burned. Some of the medical clinics are also closed.

#15. "Protesters try to take a rocket propelled grenade (RPG) from a riot

policeman"  

  

I'm sorry, if you have an RPG, you are NOT a riot policeman, you are an RPG

soldier. Your job is to seek out and destroy armored vehicles. Either the

quartermaster was on CRACK COCAINE when assigning weapons, or these are not

riot policemen, they are regular army. I don't care if they DO work for the

police, you don't bring a damn RPG to quell a riot. And look at that, the

protesters took their little RPG, so not only were the police unable to find a

marked "protstor" armored personnel carrier or a "protestor" battle tank that

would necessitate an RPG, but now they have given an RPG 18 or RPG 22 or

whatever explosive penetrator to protesters that, well that love to destroy

vehicles! God all mighty, why are people so STUPID!?

I was just in Bishkek in September 2009. It was my first time in this

beautiful country, but it will not be my last. Say what you will, but this is

not typical of these people. They are generous, caring and compassionate. This

is truly a TRAGEDY! The people who are protesting/rioting/looting have become

susceptible to group-think and mob mentality. The police which they attack

come from much the same background as the opposition.  

  

Though it was clear that the politics of the country were not truly legit,

there are many within the current regime who toil day and night to bring it up

to the standards of the rest of the free world.  

  

Their energy woes are not even related to the Kyrgyz political machine.

Kyrgyzstan is totally dependent upon border countries such as Uzbekistan (gas)

and others for their electricity. These countries on which they depend are the

reason for the skyrocketing energy prices. They have jacked up the rates in

the last couple years just because they could. Kyrgyzstan is currently working

to become an independent energy producing country and cut off this constant

dependence.  

  

Cut them some slack and say a prayer for a peaceful resolution to this

situation. This is not good for anyone.

it's awful to see this victims, wounded people and this terrific riot.  

Right now we all don't have enough information to judge on the situation,

specifically on who is behind the protestants.  

But the sides of the conflict must stop violence, avoid more victims, and

start negotiations. Civil disorder is not what Kyrgyzstan people deserve. The

people deserve responsible and wise president and government, capable to start

implementing measures against social and economical problems.

The government [from my limited understanding from reading these comments] are

the ones in the wrong, but I hate to see people fleeing in terror as they are

in #13. These are people paid to do a job, and no-one deserves to have to run

for their life. Neither do they deserve to be kicked whilst down, as the

opposition supporter in #37 is.  

  

It's a horrible situation for all involved as sh*t like this always is, and to

say - as someone commented earlier - that you find any of these photographs

funny or exciting, is just sick.

Having lived in Kyrgyzstan for over four years, until about 6 months ago, I

have to say I don't think this is either a U.S. vs. Russia or a Russia vs.

U.S. (though both have military based in the northern part of the country -

Kyrgyzstan is the only country in the world with military bases of both). For

all the reports of certain weapons or certain persons from different countries

being involved, I'd take them with more than a grain of salt - this is pretty

common rumor and rhetoric whenever there is instability, and for the most part

is almost entirely untrue. For example, there was a plane crash a couple of

years ago that was rumored to have been done by the CIA (the plane was from

Bishkek to Tehran), since two American basketball players on a USO mission in

Bishkek had supposedly left the flight at the last minute. Obviously, this was

just fantasy since there's no way two American basketball players are going on

a USO mission to Tehran!  

  

My read on it is this is primarily an internal political matter (though with a

definite regional/international dimension) and primarily about the balance of

power between factions from different regions of the country, the corruption

and growing authoritarian nature of the government and the poverty of the

people.

吉国反对派推翻现政府 总统逃离首都



国际在线报道（驻中亚记者王向东）:吉尔吉斯斯坦7日发生大规模骚乱，反对派示威者占领了议会大楼，8号凌晨，总统府也被示威者占领。而总统巴基耶夫也已乘专机飞到了南部城市奥什。国际社会纷纷表示关注，呼吁各方保持克制。  

  

据吉尔吉斯坦当地媒体的最新报道，吉尔吉斯斯坦反对派领导人萨里耶夫当地时间7日晚间在首都比什凯克向媒体宣布，政府总理乌谢诺夫已声明辞去总理职务，并将由反对派组成“人民信任”政府。  

  

据萨里耶夫透露，目前反对派已经组建了以前外长、社会民主党议会党团领袖奥通巴耶娃为首的“人民信任政府”，准备开始履行政府职能。他进一步指出，包括他本人在内的反对派人士当天进入了总统府，但巴基耶夫总统没在总统府内。据报道，一批反对派支持者7日晚闯入吉总统巴基耶夫的家庭住宅，并哄抢掠走了住宅居室内的衣物、家具、器皿、毛毯等财物。据目击者称，当时总统住宅没有守卫人员，居室内似乎空无一人。  

  

当天晚间，反对派支持者还占领了议会大楼，距离不远处的总检察院大楼也起火燃烧。据目击者称，反对派支持者冲进议会大楼时没有遭到任何抵抗，议会大楼内当时也没有滞留任何议员。有报道说，总检察长当天被示威者打成重伤，具体伤势情况目前还不知道。  

  

有媒体报道称，内务部部长孔甘季耶夫当天在塔拉斯市内务局大楼被反对派示威者扣为人质，并被殴打至重伤。此外，吉尔吉斯斯坦第一副总理扎帕罗夫也在塔拉斯市中心广场被反对派示威者扣为人质。  

  

据吉尔吉斯斯坦卫生部的最新统计，在反政府示威者与警方发生的冲突中，截止目前已有至少40多人丧生，400多人受伤。吉尔吉斯斯坦前总统阿卡耶夫当天通过“莫斯科回声”广播电台发表声明，呼吁吉现任总统巴基耶夫自动辞职，以免进一步发生流血事件。阿卡耶夫表示，他本人并不想重新步入吉政坛，吉尔吉斯斯坦应由年轻一代政治家治理。  

  

吉尔吉斯斯坦反对派人士称，本次大规模骚乱的直接导火索是政府拘捕了“阿塔—梅肯”（祖国）党副主席谢尔尼亚佐夫。6号下午，约1500名示威者围攻并占领了塔拉斯州政府大楼，将州长扣为人质，要求释放谢尔尼亚佐夫。警方出动大量警力，解救了被扣押的州长，骚乱持续到深夜。反对派计划7号在全国各地举行“人民大会”，但没有得到政府批准。7号上午，反对派支持者在全国多个州市大规模冲击政府机关。在首都比什凯克，上万名反对派示威者冲破警察在市郊的防线，聚集到位于比什凯克市中心的总统府前。他们要求总统巴基耶夫和总理乌谢诺夫出来当面谈判，但遭到政府拒绝。反对派支持者于是试图强行冲进总统府大楼，与防暴警察发生激烈冲突。此外，反对派支持者在塔拉斯州、纳伦州、楚河州等多个州冲击并占领了当地政府大楼。吉尔吉斯斯坦前总检察长、现反对派领袖之一的别克纳扎罗夫当天表示，反对派的最终目的就是夺取国家政权。当天下午，吉尔吉斯斯坦国家电视台第一频道和第五频道中断电视信号，国家电视台被反对派支持者占领。此外，比什凯克玛纳斯国际机场从当天20点关闭，所有航班一律暂时取消。因局势紧张，与吉尔吉斯斯坦相邻的哈萨克斯坦和塔吉克斯坦均加强了边境戒备。  

  

欧盟、联合国、欧洲安全与合作组织、俄罗斯、乌克兰等各国及国际组织，7号纷纷对吉尔吉斯斯坦骚乱事件发表声明，要求冲突双方保持克制，以合法的手段、通过谈判解决争端。俄罗斯当天表示对吉尔吉斯斯坦目前局势感到忧虑。俄方呼吁冲突双方在法律框架内解决分歧，不要采取暴力行动，以避免流血事件发生。  

  

俄罗斯总理普京当天驳斥了有关吉骚乱事件与俄有关的报道，他说，不管是俄罗斯，他本人，还是俄官方人员，都和吉国内的事件无关。美国白宫国家安全委员会发言人迈克·哈默7号说，美方正在密切关注局势，对有关暴力和抢劫的报道表示关切，呼吁各方禁用暴力、保持克制。

1993年宪法定义政府体制为一民主共和国。行政部门包括总统和总理，国会为两院制，司法部门包括最高法院、宪法法庭、地方法院和检察总长。  

  

2002年三月发生在南部阿赫昔区六名抗议任意拘捕反对党政治人物的民众遭警察射杀的事件，引发了全国性抗议。在民间社团和反对党代表的参与之下，阿卡耶夫总统启动了宪法改革进程。此进程最初有政府、民间、和社会代表的广大参与和开放对话，产生了2003年二月投票过程有缺失的公民投票。公民投票通过的宪法修正案导致了总统扩权和国会与宪法法庭弱化。根据新宪法，在2005年的国会选举之后，原先的两院制国会将成为75席的单院国会。  

  

过渡政府领导人正在发展新的治理结构并着手解决重要的宪法争议。国家团结委员会宣布，六月将举行总统选举，而在其三个月之后将举行国会选举。  

  

2008年12月，官方媒体UTRK宣布它要求自由欧洲电台提前递交节目，根据2005年的一项协议，UTRK应转播这些节目。[1]

UTRK在2008年10月停止了对自由欧洲电台的转播。此前一周，UTRK未能转播一个自由欧洲电台的节目“不舒服的问题”，声称丢失了未被播放的材料，而该节目涉及十月份的选举。巴基耶夫总统在2008年10月谴责了这个节目，同时UTRK告诉自由欧洲电台节目过于消极。

无国界记者强烈谴责了UTRK停止转播的决定。在该组织公布的2009年度全球新闻自由指数排名上，吉尔吉斯斯坦在175个国家中排名第125。[2]  

  

2009年2月3日，库尔曼别克·巴基耶夫总统宣布立即关闭玛纳斯空军基地——美国留在中亚的唯一军事基地。[3]

2月19日，议会以压倒性多数（78-1）通过了政府提交的关于废除美军租用玛纳斯空军基地协议基地的议案。[4]

然而，经过吉尔吉斯、俄罗斯、美国外交官的多次幕后协商之后，吉尔吉斯斯坦收回了关闭基地的决定。6月25日，吉尔吉斯斯坦议会批准了在美玛纳斯空军基地基础上建立转运中心的协议。

新的合同允许美国人继续使用该基地，然而租费从每年1740万美元涨到6000万美元。该基地将不再叫做“玛纳斯空军基地”，而更名为“物资转运中心”，只能转运非军事物资。玛纳斯空军基地的性质由之前的美军功能全面的军事基地，转变为只能向阿富汗运输非致命性设备的运输中转中心。[5][6][7]  

  

吉尔吉斯斯坦世界上二十个贪腐程度最高的国家之一：2008年吉尔吉斯斯坦的贪污感知指数是1.8（0为最腐化，10为最廉洁）。[8]

2010年4月７日吉尔吉斯当局，扣押反对派领袖，触发全国骚乱，局势失控，军警向示威者发射实弹，医生说，有数十人死亡，百多人受伤，全部死伤者是中弹；在首都比什凯克，数千名反政府示威者再度围攻总统府，士兵向人群开枪，数小时前，示威者抢夺装甲车撞向总统府大闸，防暴警员用实弹镇压；总统巴基耶夫及总理乌谢诺夫，颁布在全国实施紧急状态令，乌谢诺夫强调，政府仍掌控国家局势，绝不会同暴徒谈判，但当局其后释放十多名被扣押的反对派领导，其中一名反对派领袖，前总检察长别克纳扎罗夫声言，最终目标是夺取国家政权。在当地的新华社记者说，大批反对派支持者攻占国会大楼，总检察长被打至重伤，另一批示威者正试图攻占内务部和国防部，与警员交火，有政府建筑物着火，冒出浓烟；内务部长孔甘季耶夫被示威者扣为人质，其间一度传出死讯，第一副总理扎帕罗夫亦被胁持，示威者又占据国营电视台，市面出现抢掠，比什凯克国际机场暂时关闭

我没有说这次上来的一定不是独裁政权，我只是说明了一个趋势。  

民主化进程一旦启动，就有停不下来的趋势。

俄罗斯政府总理普京在斯摩尔陵斯克召开记者会强调，吉尔吉斯坦动乱局势与俄罗斯无关，如果有人硬加莫须有的指责强加给俄罗斯，那就是挑衅和心怀叵测。  

  

普京认为，吉尔吉斯坦应该检点经济状态，如果民不聊生，那么民众就会类似于逼上梁山的过激做法。  

  

普京强调，俄罗斯所担心见到的流血事件最终发生，这是政府倒台的直接诱因。  

  

普京表示：“唯一应该声明的是，这种起因不是因为俄罗斯，俄罗斯与此没有任何粘连，没有任何因果关系，我个人倒有想法，我回忆起当巴基耶夫总统夺取政权时，他大骂前总统阿卡耶夫在亲属执政问题，在经济和政治问题等滥用职权，在重要岗位安插亲信和亲属，我印象是巴基耶夫重上阿卡耶夫的不归船。”  

  

此前，俄外交部副部长卡拉幸就吉尔吉斯坦责备俄驻比什凯克大使，认为俄媒体歪曲比什凯克局势而发表谈话，指责吉尔吉斯坦外交部无中生有。
