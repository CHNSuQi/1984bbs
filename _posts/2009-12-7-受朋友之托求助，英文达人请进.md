下面是论文：  

  

In recent years, China's oil equipment, the number of enterprise products on

display overseas, more and more on display with their foreign counterparts,

they obviously felt their booth design standards and their foreign

counterparts gap between the hope that China University of Industrial Design

professional students to study in this regard. I decided to show the design

professional from the combination of market research to explore the Chinese

petroleum equipment company's products overseas, when it was exhibited in the

exhibition design style, design concepts, and explore how to highlight the

Chinese elements, designed to showcase the image of Chinese

products.fficeffice" />  

  

1\. Exhibition design  

  

Exhibition design is an emphasis on space environment and props form of

independent design professional, it is a space form of the composition. Shows

the environment is divided into interior space and outdoor space. Interior

space is a display-based as a starting point, under the action of the form

props in the show room shape.  

  

  

  

1.1 The concept of exhibition design space  

  

  

  

Presentation of the arts and space are inseparable, and even can be said to

demonstrate the organization of space and art is the use of art. In terms of

showing the conceptual design, showing the nature and characteristics of the

design, display design and showcase the scope of the design process, we can

find, "space" concept is through consistency. Display design is a creation of

man-made environment, spatial planning has become a core element of the art

show. Therefore, the design of space to explore the concept of space before

the first clearly is necessary, and it is every designer needs to it as "the

cornerstone of the concept of" keep in mind.  

  

  

  

1.1.1 Space duality  

  

  

  

The concept of space has a relative and absolute duality, the space the size,

shape, material, and by its envelope should have the function of its own forms

of decisions, while the space has also decided to forward the envelope in the

form of objects. "Tangible" objects so that the tube "invisible" space be made

visible, left the building envelope materials, space became the concept of

"space" can not be perceived; "invisible" space to give "tangible" in the

envelope material with practical meaning, there is no space exists, then the

envelope material would have been impossible value. For the space and its

retaining this dialectical relationship between things, the Chinese two

thousand years ago, I gave penetrating discussion on: "Gems of that device,

when it is no, there are devices used. Chisel households Shuyou that room,

when it is no , there is room only. so there's that benefit, non-use of that.

"  

  

  

1.1.2 Temporal space  

  

  

In the show we are talking about the design of four-dimensional space is, in

this sense to the usual three-dimensional space with "time" concept. Time

means that movement, set aside time to study the space will be the dull, with

no sense. Since Einstein's "Theory of Relativity", putting people's

understanding of space has been deepened, know what space and time is a

different expression. Space is limited to visible physical elements are not

visible under the formation of the virtual body and a feeling that it's

generated between visual "field" is derived from the subjective feeling of

life. And the time and this feeling is closely linked to the display

environment on people viewing the exhibits, is necessarily a dynamic view,

time is dynamic interpretation of way. In display space, it is bound to

experience the passage of time and space changes, so as to constitute a

complete sensory experience. The timing of the display of the design space is

a factor in an objective reality, make full use of time, this "fourth

dimension" is to create a dynamic space form of the fundamental, but also to

create a "movement of the United States" to pass.  

  

  

1.1.3 Spatial mobility  

  

  

During the display environment, the space has the mobility is inevitable,

which is exhibition space features from the decision. Display space is a space

and site planning of the art is in a specific spatial scale with the

performance of certain means of conveying information to the audience, it

makes the audience like a huge exposure to the art of sculpture in a dynamic

way with the display performance, planning on the conscious guidance, so that

the audience experience the space-time three-dimensional space generated by

fourth-dimensional effect.Show flat planning, can cause a variety of spatial

effect. Such as the composition of planar flow geometry straight line, people

have a rational, orderly  

  

  

  

1.2 Display environment on the handling of function space  

  

  

The space environment of any nature are formed by a variety of functional

space, while the display environment, because of their special nature, the

performance by means of space to transmit information to the audience, to

promote and deepen corporate and product image of the goal, so it has the the

organization of function space includes plans that have higher requirements.

Only handle the various functional space such as public space, information

space, auxiliary function space, storage space, staff room, reception space,

the relationship between, so that harmony and unity of their existence and a

public space within, can we really show a good sense of design.  

  

Demonstrate the art of art is very practical, no one show is designed to

organize the elements for some purpose and thus to become a whole. Doing a

show designed functional partition of space is a priority, but also smooth the

process of successful completion of the basic protection of the entire show.

Function zoning is the showcase of a variety of functions and linkages between

them, spatial analysis, so that space-partitioning to meet the functional

needs. Example, independent of the exhibition booth design, it is necessary to

conduct functional analysis of space, appropriate configuration, such as

negotiating areas, display areas, merchandise or corporate image display area,

and so functional areas, while also considering the coordination of the entire

exhibition style unity. Another example is displayed in the environment of

public space, for public use and activities in the region, in the planning

should pay attention to four issues: the need to facilitate access to,

adequate and the plot, there should be enough room for people to talk instead

of affect other visitors, it should be to provide rest and water space.  

  

The display of contemporary art has developed into a comprehensive reflection

of modern scientific and technological achievements, the composition of the

factors involved are becoming increasingly complex and integrated into the

digital means, one method of optical sound, etc., corresponding, it is a

function of space updates and additions. This gives designers the analysis of

the spatial plan put forward higher requirements. On the display of the

environment itself, with reasonable space designed to showcase the design

constitutes jumping rhythm, smooth and rhythmic art of the key results;

correctly handle and grasp the function space of the complementary

relationship is to construct the ideal environment for the essence of the

display.  

  

  

  

1.3 Demonstrate some of the basic principles of space design  

  

  

  

1.3.1 With dynamic serialization, there are rhythmic form of the space show  

  

  

  

Exhibition space mentioned earlier, the biggest feature is a very strong

liquidity, so in space designed to take advantage dynamic serialization, there

are rhythmic display of the form must first follow the basic principle, which

is by the exhibition space of the nature and human factors. People visited the

display space in the state of the movement is in motion and get the ultimate

space experience feelings. This requires display space must be as a basis for

the most reasonable way to streamline arrangements for the audience to visit,

so that the audience in the flow and complete, the economy involved in

demonstration activities, as much as possible without taking away or less

repeated the line, in particular, is not displayed in key areas, repeated

treatment in the space to do just like music melody like a smooth, distinct

cadence have caused. A matter of course the whole design. To meet the function

while people feel the charm and design of spatial variation of the infinite

fun.  

  

  

  

1.3.2 In space designed to take into account the human factor, so that space

to better serve the people  

  

  

  

The basic structure of exhibition space from the workplace structure, and the

path structure, and the field structure of the composition, structure,

properties of which place is to demonstrate the basic properties of space.

Because place and space to reflect the most basic of human relationships. It

is shown that the human subject. Through the center (ie premises), direction

(ie the path), regional (ie fields) synergistic relationship between the

"force" that "highlights the social and psychological state of the human

position." Is a human given the fourth-dimensional display space, making it

the state from the unreal display of the environment through human action

reveals it, while people in the course of this experience of space, access to

all of the psychological feelings. "Man" is the exhibition space the ultimate

service, thus putting people at the spiritual level as animals on the high-

level requirements is to demonstrate one aspect of the design that must be

met.  

  

  

Exhibition Design need to meet people in the dual physical and spiritual

needs, this is exhibition space during the fundamental basis for the analysis.

Display of human needs comfortable and harmonious environment, sensual taste

for demonstration effect, information-rich display the contents of safe and

convenient space for planning, thoughtful services and facilities, etc., these

are human beings in the spirit of the display design requests. This requires

designers to carefully analyze the activities of visitors behavior and

conducted in the juice with a scientific attitude of the ergonomics give full

attention, so that display space of the shape, size and human-scale

cooperation between the appropriate, so that the proportion of the various

parts of space, scale and people's perception in space operations and

appropriate ways to co-ordinate, coordinate, which is the most basic space

requirements. Same time, people should be in a comfortable environment for the

activities, if not create a psychological closeness to give people a warm

feeling of space, even using the most advanced means of display environment is

cold mechanical composition of the empty shell with no life . An exhibition

space filled with user-friendly is a "sensible", "reasonable" design.  

  

  

  

1.3.3 The most effective space to display exhibits  

  

  

  

Exhibits is the protagonist of exhibition space in the most effective venue

for location of the exhibits presented to the audience is the primary purpose

of dividing the space. Display order logic design, layout display scheme, the

rational allocation is to use exhibition space for the prerequisite to achieve

the best display results. Thus, designers must be space and display the

contents be considered together, the different display contents corresponding

to display the form and space division. Such as the display of a commercial

nature activities require more open space, space and space for interaction

between the penetration, the location of exhibits to be visible, for those who

demonstrate the visual focal point, such as sound, light, electricity,

dynamics and simulation, and display the form, it is necessary give full and

prominent display space in order to enhance the visual impact on people, give

the audience left a deep impression. In short, to exhibit a reasonable

position is to demonstrate the spatial planning top priority issue, but also

made a successful show can design the key.  

  

  

  

Show activities require the message to be displayed in the public eye through

space and space activities for our perception of the place, no space, we will

be unable to access to information and people can not share. In short,

properly handle the issue of space is to demonstrate the essence of the

design; a correct understanding of the relationship between space and the

display design is to do a design premise and foundation; better use of "space"

language can be designed to give a real meaning and vitality of the design.

麻烦楼主抑扬告诉我具体修改什么？是仅仅修改句子吗？这方面越具体越好。某些段落推到重写可以吗？  

  

如果没人揭榜，在下愿意效此案牍之劳。  

  

如果帮不上，我会马上告诉你。你另谋高人。  

  

告诉我时间限制。就是在几天之内。  

  

不得不在编辑一次：好心人是不敢当的，其他的托福六级八级国外生活更是没有，俺一打工的烂仔，更说不上有两天空闲。无非因缘附会，可能帮上一点忙。

在下无意知道她的更多的事情，但是请告诉她关于修改文章的要求我知道的越详细越好。  

  

同时告诉她，有些事在我的能力范围之外，无法控制。无非尽力而已。  

  

尚未有一箭之功，倒是让老西屡屡致谢，很是惶恐。有收了款却交不出货的担忧。

我朋友的评论  

\-------------------------------------------------------  

论文错误太多，根本无从下手，要改就要全部重写。  

  

比如开头第一段，就要全部重写。个人建议： 不要用太多从句，复杂的句型弄不好就会让人一头雾水，不知道作者要说什么。  

  

你让作者自己检查第一段，试试找出每一句的主谓宾来。
