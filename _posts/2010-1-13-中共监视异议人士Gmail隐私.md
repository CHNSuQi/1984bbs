China - Internet - Google

Google, the world's leading search engine, has thrown down the gauntlet to

China by announcing it is no longer willing to censor search results on its

Chinese version.  

  

In a shock announcement the internet giant said the decision followed cyber

attacks which appeared to be an attempt to gather information on Chinese human

rights activists.  

  

It also comes amid an increasing clampdown on the internet in China over the

last year.  

  

Google acknowledged that the decision might well mean Google.cn, and

potentially the company's offices in China, would have to close.  

  

In a post on the official Google Blog, the company outlined a December attack

which it believes affected at least 20 other firms, adding: "These attacks and

the surveillance they have uncovered – combined with the attempts over the

past year to further limit free speech on the web – have led us to conclude

that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in China.  

  

"We have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on

Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the

Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search

engine within the law, if at all. We recognize that this may well mean having

to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China.  

  

The message, headlined "A New Approach to China" and signed by David Drummond,

Senior vice president of Corporate Development and Chief Legal Officer, adds

that the firm launched google.cn in January 2006 – a decision criticised by

some activists at the time – "in the belief that the benefits of increased

access to information for people in China and a more open Internet outweighed

our discomfort in agreeing to censor some results."  

  

At the time the firm said that it would carefully monitor conditions in China,

including new laws and other restrictions on our services, and would

reconsider its approach if necessary.  

  

谷歌之举可能意味着终止在中国的业务。

Google威胁退出中国，世上或再无谷歌。



Google Threatens Pullout From China After E-Mail Accounts Are Hacked.  

  

Google threatened to end its operations in China after it discovered that the

e-mail accounts of human rights activistshad been breached.  

  

The company said it had detected a "highly sophisticated and targeted attack

on our corporate infrastructure originatingfrom China." Google says further

investigation revealed that "a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the

Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists." Google did not specifically

accuse the Chinese government. But the company added that it is "no longer

willing to continue censoring our results" on its Chinese search engine, as

the government requires. Google says the decision could force it to shut down

its Chinese site and its offices in the country.

Google遇袭，或将退出中国。



Google, Citing Cyber Attack, Threatens to Exit China  

By MIGUEL HELFT and JOHN MARKOFF  

  

Google threatened late Tuesday to pull out of its operations in China after it

said it had uncovered a massive cyber attack on its computers that originated

there.  

  

As a result, the company said, it would no longer agree to censor its search

engine in China and may exit the country altogether.  

谷歌公司可能不再过滤其中文搜索结果，并同时退出中国市场。  

  

Google said that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail

accounts of Chinese human right activists, but that the attack also targeted

20 other large companies in the finance, technology, media and chemical

sectors.  

谷歌公司表示，攻击者的主要目的是进入中国人权活动人士们的Gmail账户……  

  

In a blog posting by David Drummond, the corporate development and chief legal

officer, Google said that it had found a “highly sophisticated and targeted

attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China.”  

  

“These attacks and the surveillance they have uncovered — combined with the

attempts over the past year to further limit free speech on the web — have led

us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business

operations in China,” Mr. Drummond wrote in a blog post.  

  

He wrote that Google was no longer willing to censor results on its Chinese-

language search engine and would discuss with Chinese authorities whether it

could operate an uncensored search engine in that country.  

  

“We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and

potentially our offices in China,” Mr. Drummond wrote, adding that the

decision was being driven by executives in the United States, “without the

knowledge or involvement of our employees in China.”  

  

Google did not publicly link the Chinese government to the cyber attack, but

people with knowledge of Google’s investigation said they had enough evidence

to justify its actions.  

谷歌没有公开表示中国政府与此次黑客袭击有关，但是了解谷歌调查结果的人士称他们有足够的证据证明这一点。  

  

A United States expert on cyber warfare said that 34 companies were targeted,

most of them high-technology companies in Silicon Valley. The attacks came

from Taiwanese Internet addresses, according to James Mulvenon, an expert on

Chinese cyberwarfare capabilities.  

  

Mr. Mulvenon said that the stolen documents were sent electronically to a

server controlled by Rackspace, based in San Antonio.  

  

“For Google to pull up stakes and basically pull out China, the attack must

have been large in scope and very penetrating,” Mr. Mulvenon said. “This

attack highlights the fact that cyberwarfare has basically gone to the next

level.”  

  

Mr. Drummond said that Google decided to speak publicly about the attack not

only because of its security and human rights implications, but because “this

information goes to the heart of a much bigger global debate about freedom of

speech.”  

  

Google entered the China market in 2006, agreeing to introduce a censored

search engine. At the time, the company said that it believed that the

benefits of its presence in China outweighed the downside of being forced to

censor some search results there, as it would provide more information and

openness to Chinese citizens.  

  

But the company said that it would continue to monitor restrictions in that

country and review its decision periodically.

Search Engine Land的主编在第一时间邮件采访了Google总部几个问题：  

  

你们能谈谈你们所谓的知识产权被盗是怎么回事？你们的意思是Gmail的代码还是什么？  

  

这个问题我们还在调查中，目前无法给你细节。  

  

谁在攻击Gmail？  

  

目前我们也不知道。但很清楚的是中国大陆依然没有一个开放的互联网环境。这使得攻击者可以很轻松的进行攻击，所以我们觉得自己在中国的搜索引擎进行审查很傻很天真。  

  

你的意思是说谷歌中国的搜索审查已经在你们博客文章发出后取消了吗？  

  

没有，博客里我们说的是不愿意再进行审查了，并希望在接下来几周和政府讨论在法律框架下做一个没有审查的搜索引擎。  

  

请大家和谐评论，谢谢！

Google的逆袭



http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html  

  

A new approach to China  

  

1/12/2010 03:00:00 PM  

Like many other well-known organizations, we face cyber attacks of varying

degrees on a regular basis. In mid-December, we detected a highly

sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating

from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google.

However, it soon became clear that what at first appeared to be solely a

security incident--albeit a significant one--was something quite different.  

  

First, this attack was not just on Google. As part of our investigation we

have discovered that at least twenty other large companies from a wide range

of businesses--including the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical

sectors--have been similarly targeted. We are currently in the process of

notifying those companies, and we are also working with the relevant U.S.

authorities.  

  

Second, we have evidence to suggest that a primary goal of the attackers was

accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. Based on our

investigation to date we believe their attack did not achieve that objective.

Only two Gmail accounts appear to have been accessed, and that activity was

limited to account information (such as the date the account was created) and

subject line, rather than the content of emails themselves.  

  

Third, as part of this investigation but independent of the attack on Google,

we have discovered that the accounts of dozens of U.S.-, China- and Europe-

based Gmail users who are advocates of human rights in China appear to have

been routinely accessed by third parties. These accounts have not been

accessed through any security breach at Google, but most likely via phishing

scams or malware placed on the users' computers.  

  

We have already used information gained from this attack to make

infrastructure and architectural improvements that enhance security for Google

and for our users. In terms of individual users, we would advise people to

deploy reputable anti-virus and anti-spyware programs on their computers, to

install patches for their operating systems and to update their web browsers.

Always be cautious when clicking on links appearing in instant messages and

emails, or when asked to share personal information like passwords online. You

can read more here about our cyber-security recommendations. People wanting to

learn more about these kinds of attacks can read this U.S. government report

(PDF), Nart Villeneuve's blog and this presentation on the GhostNet spying

incident.  

  

We have taken the unusual step of sharing information about these attacks with

a broad audience not just because of the security and human rights

implications of what we have unearthed, but also because this information goes

to the heart of a much bigger global debate about freedom of speech. In the

last two decades, China's economic reform programs and its citizens'

entrepreneurial flair have lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese people out

of poverty. Indeed, this great nation is at the heart of much economic

progress and development in the world today.  

  

We launched Google.cn in January 2006 in the belief that the benefits of

increased access to information for people in China and a more open Internet

outweighed our discomfort in agreeing to censor some results. At the time we

made clear that "we will carefully monitor conditions in China, including new

laws and other restrictions on our services. If we determine that we are

unable to achieve the objectives outlined we will not hesitate to reconsider

our approach to China."  

  

These attacks and the surveillance they have uncovered--combined with the

attempts over the past year to further limit free speech on the web--have led

us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business

operations in China. We have decided we are no longer willing to continue

censoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be

discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an

unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all. We recognize that this may

well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China.  

  

The decision to review our business operations in China has been incredibly

hard, and we know that it will have potentially far-reaching consequences. We

want to make clear that this move was driven by our executives in the United

States, without the knowledge or involvement of our employees in China who

have worked incredibly hard to make Google.cn the success it is today. We are

committed to working responsibly to resolve the very difficult issues raised.

Google Warns of China Exit Over Hacking  

http://online.wsj.com/article/SB ... _LEADNewsCollection  

  

Web Giant Says Cyber Attack Targeted at Least 20 Foreign Firms, Email of

Rights Activists; A Major Challenge to Beijing  

  

Google Inc. said it may back out of China after an investigation found the

company had been hit with major cyber attacks it believes originated from the

country -- a move that would amount to one of the highest-profile rebukes yet

of China by a major U.S. firm.  

  

Google said it believed the attackers were trying to access the Gmail accounts

of Chinese human-rights activists. It said at least 20 other large companies

were also targeted and that it was in the process of notifying those companies

and working with U.S. authorities.  

  

A Google spokesman declined to identify the 20 other companies.  

  

The company said it will be talking with the Chinese government in coming

weeks about how it might operate in China without censorship, long a thorn in

the side of Western Web concerns operating there. "We have decided we are no

longer willing to continue censoring our results" on its China Web site,

Google.cn," the company's chief legal officer, David Drummond, said in the

post.

Journal Community  

  

Vote: Should Google leave China over cyber attacks?  

"We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and

potentially our offices in China," Mr. Drummond wrote.  

  

For Google to withdraw from China would be an extremely rare repudiation by a

Western company of what is almost universally seen in big business as one of

the world's most important markets. Even the public suggestion that it is

considering such a move is likely to infuriate Chinese authorities.  

  

Chinese officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment. The government

in the past has repeatedly defended its handling of the Internet, and has

rejected accusations that China is responsible for cyber attacks against

foreign entities.  

  

Google launched its Chinese-language search engine in 2006, agreeing to censor

some of its results, a move that sparked sharp criticism from human-rights

groups and Web-industry officials who are critical of any restrictions on the

Internet.  

  

Tensions between Google and the Chinese government began soon, escalating in

2009 when Chinese officials reprimanded Google and accused it of having

pornography on its sites; several Google services were temporarily

inaccessible in China. Google's video-sharing site, YouTube, has also been

inaccessible within China for the past number of months, and has been

periodically banned in the past.  

  

Google's move comes as the company has been in negotiations with Chinese

officials over various Google services in China. Last year, it agreed to

remove some foreign-language links on its China homepage to placate Chinese

officials.  

  

Google said yesterday it was making its move because it detected a "highly

sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating

from China" in mid-December. Google said the attack resulted in "the theft of

intellectual property from Google." The company said that only two Gmail

accounts appeared to have been accessed.  

  

"These attacks and the surveillance they have uncovered -- combined with the

attempts over the past year to further limit free speech on the Web -- have

led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business

operations in China," Google's Mr. Drummond wrote.  

  

"We will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could

operate an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all," he wrote.  

  

Google has struggled to gain search-market share in China, against local

Chinese company Baidu Inc., which leads the market. Google's share of China's

search market by revenue has been growing and stood at 29% in the second

quarter of 2009, according to research firm Analysys International.  

  

Google's main Chinese competitors, especially Baidu, are seen as far more

ready to comply with government-censorship rules, and have avoided the

periodic blocking and official criticism that Google has experienced.  

  

Google's revenue in China is relatively small, with analysts estimating that

only a few percentage points of Google's company's nearly $22 billion in 2008

revenue came from the nation. But the country's massive number of Internet

users has made it strategically important for Google, as it tried to extend

its dominance in search and search advertising around the globe.  

  

Google suffered another setback in September when Kai-Fu Lee, the high-profile

former Microsoft Corp. executive it had hired in 2005 to lead its China

operation, left to work on his own Chinese Internet venture.  

  

Google may go the way of other Internet companies, such as eBay Inc. and Yahoo

Inc., which abandoned expansion plans in China in recent years -- although

none of them in the publicly critical way that Google is suggesting. Both

transferred their China businesses to local players in exchange for equity

stakes.  

  

Foreign Internet companies have all struggled in China both against tough

commercial competition and also government regulation and censorship.  

  

The common assumption, however, is that no matter how onerous the limitations

and challenges faced by foreign companies in China, the market is too big and

important to walk away from.  

  

That calculation has forced a number of foreign firms to accept conditions in

China that they might not tolerate elsewhere. The country has 338 million

Internet users as of June, more than any other country.  

  

Google would be the most high-profile Western company in recent years to draw

a line under the kind of compromises it is prepared to make and walk away from

China.  

  

It would be an extremely rare case of a foreign company taking a stand on

human rights, and placing that issue over commercial considerations. A number

of foreign companies exited China after the Chinese army crushed student

protesters around Tiananmen Square in 1989. But they mostly came back in the

following years.  

  

A Google withdrawal would also be an implicit rejection of the argument made

by many technology companies that their presence in China overall helps expand

access to information for Chinese citizens, despite censorship.

路透社：  

  

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Google Inc (GOOG.O) said it may pull out of

China because it is no longer willing to accept censorship of search results

and after hackers coordinated a sophisticated attack on email accounts of

human rights activists using its Gmail service.  

  

Google's surprise announcement on Tuesday came shortly after an adviser to

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she will announce a technology

policy next week to help citizens in other countries to gain access to an

uncensored Internet [ID:nWEN8321]  

  

More than 20 other companies were also attacked by the China-based hackers,

Google said.  

  

Google said the hackers had tried to access the Gmail email accounts of

Chinese human rights activists but only managed to access two unidentified

accounts, and then only headlines and other data such as when the account was

created.  

  

It did not say what information the hackers tried to access from the other

corporations, nor which they were. Google said it was now notifying the other

affected corporations, adding that it was working with the U.S. authorities.  

  

"These attacks and the surveillance they have uncovered -- combined with

attempts over the past year to limit free speech on the Web -- have led us to

conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in

China," Google said in a statement.  

  

(For the full text of Google's statement, click here l)  

  

Google maintains a Chinese language website, Google.cn, which the company says

complies with local laws. The company's flagship, English-language site

Google.com does not adhere to China's rules.  

  

"We have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on

Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the

Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search

engine within the law, if at all."  

  

"We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and

potentially our offices in China."  

  

Human rights has been a frequent source of tension between the United States

and China, which is the largest holder of U.S. Treasuries, with total holdings

of $798.9 billion.  

  

Last week Clinton dined with tech heavyweights such as Google Chief Executive

Eric Schmidt, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) research

chief Craig Mundie, and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) Executive Vice President

Sue Bostrom. It was not clear if that meeting was related to Google's

revelation.  

上周克林顿与几家科技巨头共进晚餐，不知是否与google此举有关。（也许google只是第一波。）

以下为谷歌官方博客全文（本文尚在持续更新中）：  

  

标题：中国新路径  

  

内文：  

  

与其他很多著名组织一样，我们经常会碰到各种各样的网络攻击。去年12月中旬，我们检测到一次来自中国的，对我们集团网络设备高度精密和有针对性的网络攻击，在此次攻击中，谷歌公司的知识产权遭到窃取。我们很快就查清这并非只是一场单纯的安全事件。  

  

首先，此次攻击并非仅仅针对谷歌。我们在调查中发现，至少有其他20家大型公司也成为了类似的攻击目标，这些公司所在的行业分布广泛---

包括互联网、金融、科技、媒体和化工行业。我们目前正在通知这些公司，并与美国有关部门携手展开调查。  

  

第二，我们有证据表明攻击者的主要目标是入侵中国人权活动者的Gmail邮箱账户。根据我们掌握的调查数据，我们确信他们的攻击还未能达此目的。只有两个Gmail账户有被侵入过的迹象，而入侵者的活动范围也仅限于账户信息（如账户创建时的数据）和邮件主题，而不是邮件内容。  

  

第三，我们在对谷歌案件的调查中发现，有很多拥护人权活动，注册地在美国、中国和欧洲的Gmail邮箱账户似乎经常受到第三方侵入。入侵者并非是通过Google的安全漏洞进行攻击，而极有可能是通过在用户的电脑内植入钓鱼网页或是恶意软件来达到目的。  

  

我们已经利用从这次攻击中所获取的资料，改善基础设施及架构，提高谷歌及我们用户的安全。从个人用户来说，我们我们建议他们在自己的电脑上安装信誉好的反病毒和反间谍软件程序，给他们的操作系统安装补丁，并更新所使用的网络浏览器。在点击即时信息和电子邮件的链接时，或要求在线提供个人密码等个人资料时，要保持警惕。在这里，你能够阅读到更多我们所提出的关于电子安全方面的建议。如果希望获得更多关于这种类型攻击情况，请阅读美国政府的这份报告（PDF）。  

  

2006年1月，虽然我们对一些搜索结果将受到审查而感到不适，但为了加强与中国用户的联系以及建立一个更为开放的互联网环境，我们还是发布了

Google.cn。从发布之日起我们就有着明确的运营思路---

我们将仔细审视中国的运营环境，包括新法律的发布以及对我们所服务领域的其他规定。如果我们认为我们无法取得既定目标，我们将毫不犹豫的重新考虑我们在中国的发展策略。  

  

这些未经报道的攻击和监视，以及过去几年来政府试图进一步限制互联网上的言论自由已使我们得出结论，我们应重新审视我们在中国的业务运营。我们已决定我们将不再继续审查Google.cn上的搜索结果，且如有可能的话，未来几周内我们将与中国政府就我们是否可以依法运营一个未经过滤的搜索引擎展开讨论。我们认识到这可能意味着我们不得不关闭Google.cn，并有可能关闭我们设在中国的办公部门。

几点看法：  

1\.

.cn不可能关闭，谷歌不可能撤退。美国总部只是说说而已，中国这边这么多合作伙伴、赞助商、广告客户、合作网站怎么办？这要撕毁多少合同啊，根本不可能的事，中国管理层肯定集体抵制。  

2\. 跟全部发展潜力比起来，网络审查只是九牛一毛，可做的事还有很多很多，就为了一个审查就放弃5年的积累和这么大市场，太不值了。  

3\. 中国政府希望google撤退，他巴不得你走呢，竞争对手也这么想，你走了正中这些人的下怀，所以google现在需要调整心态，在中国就别扯那些don't

do evil的鬼话，我遵守中国的审查要求，但我用打擦边球的方式跟你们丫死磕，给你们添堵，同时做大做强，google有技术，纯竞争的话可以横扫其它对手。  

  

其实中国的大部分企业都是在夹缝中求生存的，每天都会遇到这样那样的难题，谷歌如果因为一个问题就撤退，那我只能说他太傻比了。

不同意！  

“谷歌公司表示，攻击者的主要目的是进入中国人权活动人士们的Gmail账户… ”

“谷歌没有公开表示中国政府与此次黑客袭击有关，但是了解谷歌调查结果的人士称他们有足够的证据证明这一点。”————

这种行为已经严重影响到google的各种业务，google没理由不作出反映；只能说垬SB，使这种下三滥手段自找没趣。

兄弟说的都对——中国企业家都这么想。  

  

美国的商业社会和咱们大相径庭。小弟也不懂，建议感兴趣的可以找一下美国Top Ten商学院的MBA课程看看，特别是Business Ethics部分。

For some background information:  

GFW research team tried heavily to crack down the SSL certificate for gmail

(thus, they can censor the gmail content through GFW).

跟他性格有关系，李开复这人是个理想主义者。如果换个性格刚毅、柔韧有余的总裁，能化解任何压力，任何企业都能做大。事在人为，关键看你怎么做。  

  

我们单位也算半个外企，总公司在美国，我们经常安排中国的领导到美国考察，招待方式和中国一样，喝大酒逛赌场，陪领导完美了，丫就签字。相反，如果美国公司的人来中国，就必须严格按照美国的招待习惯，不能出一点差错，我意思是，跟什么人办什么事，跟傻逼就要说混话，在中国别讲那套。

胡舒立毕竟只有大陆人能做  

审查还好说，Google如果泄露了客户资料，就不仅仅是商业道德的问题  

明显是触犯了美国的信息安全法
