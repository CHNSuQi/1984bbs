习近平出访随行人员与支持西藏独立者发生肢体冲突



A New Zealand legislator waving a Tibetan flag has accused members of a

delegation accompanying China's Vice President Xi Jinping of assaulting him

outside parliament in Wellington.  

  

Green Party co-leader Russel Norman complained to police on Friday after

clashing with the delegation members, believed to be security guards, as the

Chinese heir apparent arrived at parliament on the second day of a three-day

visit.  

  

Norman was waving the Tibetan flag and calling for democracy as Xi - who is

seen as the frontrunner to succeed President Hu Jintao in the next two years -

arrived in front of the parliament.  

  

One of Xi's party tried to place an umbrella in front of Norman, who fought

back when about a dozen security officers surrounded him, tore the flag out of

his hands and threw it to the ground.  

  

Norman shouted out that freedom of speech could be suppressed in China but not

in New Zealand.  

  

"I think it's pretty outrageous that Chinese security can come to our country

and push around an elected member of parliament simply because we are standing

up for democracy and freedom in our own country," he said later.  

  

"The Chinese security guards elbowed me out of the way, and then I got an

umbrella over the top of me and they took the flag out my hands and trampled

on it," Norman said.  

  

He said it was unacceptable for a foreign country's security services to

"rough up" a legislator outside parliament.  

  

During the scuffle, Xi was escorted into the building for a meeting with

parliamentary Speaker Lockwood Smith.  

  

"I've laid a complaint with the police because New Zealanders need to know

they are free to speak without fear of violence or recrimination," Norman

said.  

  

"Because (Prime Minister) John Key's government let Chinese security control

our parliament, it stopped being a safe place for democracy."  

  

Key said the incident would be investigated and while he supported freedom of

speech, it would be a shame if the incident overshadowed Xi's visit.  

  

"It is likely to be the thing that this trip is remembered for and that's

disappointing because it's otherwise been an extremely successful - and I

think important - visit of the vice president to New Zealand," he said.  

  

The vice president is on a tour of the region that takes him to Australia on

Saturday.  

  

Xi brought a large business delegation with him as both countries aim to

expand economic ties after New Zealand became the first developed economy to

sign a free trade agreement with China in 2008.

据新西兰《自治领邮报（Dominion

Post）》6月18日（周五）报道，中国国家副主席习近平周五抵达新西兰国会时，一名中方随从撕毁了新西兰绿党国会议员Russel

Norman握在手中的一面西藏旗帜。Norman表示，他认为该名男子是习近平的保镖。  

  

习近平一行六辆车的车队由警车开道抵达国会，这些中方保彪起初是用身体和雨伞挡住Norman手中的旗子，随后习近平的一名随从抢过并撕毁了该旗子并踩之脚下，这时习近平一行快速通过国会大门。  

  

Norman对这些中方男子说：“别把你们不民主的行动带到我们国家。”  

  

事后Norman气愤地表示，他不能100％肯定那些人是中方保镖，“但看上去很象。”  

  

Norman说：“这些中方保镖能跑到我们国家来，还推撞民选的国会议员，原因仅仅是我站在自己的国土上，在自己的国会表达民主与自由，想到这真让人恼火。”  

  

“这些中方保镖，先是用肘子撞我，让我让开，又在我头顶上撑开了一把雨伞，然后抢走我手中的旗子并踩在脚下。”  

  

事发时，Norman手持一面西藏旗帜，并向习近平高呼“民主与人权”。

事件最新进展  

  

警方将对绿党领袖Russel Norman的投诉展开调查。惠灵顿警方长官Peter Cowan表示，警方是当天下午接到Norman博士的投诉的。  

  

现场众多照片清晰显示，Norman博士当天下午在挥舞一面西藏旗帜抗议时被陪同中国副主席的一名中方安全人员用手抓住。  

  

Cowan警官说：警方将对Norman博士的投诉展开迅速调查，结果如何目前尚言之过早。警方将与目击者谈话，并观看现场的照片与录像，及与依法发放在国会抗议许可的国会发言人核实情况。

习近平保镖对新西兰国会议员动粗  

  

大叽歪记者徐亦扬、易凡新西兰综合报导）新西兰绿党联合党魁、国会议员罗素‧诺曼（Russel

Norman）博士由于反对中共对西藏的长期迫害而在习近平6月18日上午访问新西兰首都之际在国会大厦前向习近平展开雪山狮子旗。然而，他却被习近平的保镖粗暴对待，诺曼博士因此感到非常气愤，并准备向国会发言人进行投诉。

博士在国会大厦前打开西藏雪山狮子旗 （绿党办公室图片）  

  

绿党国会议员诺曼博士向习近平展开了雪山狮子旗时被中国代表团成员看到这一幕，他们随即推搡诺曼博士，用一把伞袭击博士并撕扯他手中的旗子。诺曼博士撇开试图挡在他面前的伞，但中国保镖们夺走了诺曼博士手中的旗子，将它扔到地上并践踏，诺曼博士因此和他们发生冲突。诺曼博士向这些保镖喊道，你们可以在中国镇压言论自由，但这里是新西兰。  

  

诺曼博士事后向在场记者表示他对此事非常震惊。他说：“中共的保镖到我们国家来，在我们自己的国会门口推开一个民众选出的国会议员而仅仅因为我们支持民主与自由，我认为这简直是极其蛮横无理！”  

  

诺曼博士说，中国的保镖人数看上去比新西兰本国的保安人员要多，他说：“中国保镖用手将我推开，他们从我手里抢走了旗子，但新西兰的保安人员却并没有给予很大帮助。”保安放开他后，诺曼博士继续喊道：“你能在中国剥夺人权，但是在这里不行！你能在中国压制自由和民主，但是在这里不行！”他也告诉中国访问团的人们：“别把你们非民主的东西带到我们国家来。”  

  

诺曼博士说，他从来没在国会遇到过这种待遇，说的同时手上还有一些血迹。“我一定会将此事告知议会发言人，并跟他讨论外国的保镖在国会山庄的场地粗暴对待一个本国国会议员，这样的行为是否能被接受。我认为这是绝对不能被接受的事情。”  

  

现场目睹整件事情的一名媒体记者表示，中国保镖对诺曼博士非常粗暴并形容整个事件过程“非常离奇”。他说：“我从来没有见过一个国会议员被如此残暴对待过。诺曼博士被禁止靠近习近平附近的任何地方。”“如果一个人挥舞西藏的旗子就明显地被视为冒犯中国。但我们生活在一个民主的国家，我们应该能够像诺曼博士一样来表达我们的观点和意见。”  

  

绿党在随后发表的声明中称，诺曼博士在自己国家的国会被外国保镖虐待已经揭示出主张民主和人权是相当重要的。  

  

诺曼博士在声明中说：“因为约翰‧凯伊（John

Key）领导的新西兰政府让中国保镖控制了我们的国会，因此国会不再是一个能安全表达民主的地方。我已经向警方报案，因为新西兰人应该知道，新西兰民众有权利在没有暴力和指责的环境下自由发表言论。”  

  

诺曼博士也表示，政府必须保护本国公民自由发表言论的权利，因为它是民主的基石之一。他说：

“我正在要求总理发表一份明确的声明，以表示这样的行为在新西兰是不能被接受的。”  

  

国会发言人洛克伍德‧史密斯（Lockwood Smith）称，他会对此事进行调查。  

  

这起外交事件的出现迫使习近平和工党领袖菲尔‧高夫（Phil Goff）的会议改变了地点。工党发言人说，来宾和庆典办公室告知改变会见地点，但没有告知理由。  

  

诺曼博士的政治和媒体顾问凯文‧李斯特（Kevin List）先生告诉本报记者，诺曼博士目前正在警察局录口供，他在今天的事件发生后感到非常疲惫。

MP to lay assault complaint after protest



MP to lay assault complaint after protest  

The Dominion Post Last updated 15:06 18/06/2010  

  

Green MP Russel Norman will lay an assault complaint with police after

officials in Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping's entourage tore a Tibetan flag

from the MP at Parliament today.  

  

Arriving in a convoy of around six vehicles with a police escort, the guards

initially tried to shield the flag with their bodies and umbrellas before it

was torn from Dr Norman's hand with a member of the vice president's entourage

standing on it as the VIP was rushed through the front entrance of Parliament.  

  

''I think it's pretty outrageous that Chinese security can come to our country

and push around an elected Member of Parliament simply because you're standing

up for democracy and freedom in our own country on our own parliamentary

grounds,'' Dr Norman said afterwards.  

  

''I mean, the Chinese security guards, they elbowed me out of the way, they

put an umbrella over the top of me and they took the flag out of my hands and

trampled on it.''  

  

With some blood on his hand following the scuffle, Dr Norman said he had never

experienced such treatment on Parliament's grounds. He believed it was one of

the vice president's security guards.  

  

''We were roughed up, they grabbed us and pushed us around.''   He said he was

pushed when he tried to grab the flag back.  

  

Around 30 pro-Chinese government supporters were on site to welcome the

second-most powerful man intheir country.  

  

''Don't bring your undemocratic processes to our country,'' Dr Norman had told

the Chinese VIPs.  

  

Dr Norman said he would be speaking with the Speaker of the House about the

incident. This afternoon he also indicated that he would lay a complaint with

police.  

  

After meeting the vice president, Speaker Lockwood Smith said he would

investigate the incident but had not seen it.  

  

Meanwhile, the diplomatic incident appears to have forced a change in the

venue for a meeting with Labour leader Phil Goff.  

  

Mr Goff's office confirmed that a scheduled meeting at Parliament between him

and the Chinese Vice President had been moved to the Hotel InterContinental.  

  

A spokesman said the change in venue had been advised by the Visits and

Ceremonial Office but they had been given no reason for the switch.  

  

VIP TREATMENT  

  

Relations between China and New Zealand had so far on this trip been at an

all-time high, with Prime Minister  

  

John Key ''pulling out all the stops'' for Mr Xi's visit.  

  

Ad Feedback Last night Mr Key was host at a dinner held for the Vice President

at Government House in Auckland.  

  

Mr Xi's visit yesterday included his first public speech to a major business

audience in New Zealand.  

  

Mr Key said Mr Xi's visit was part of an important exercise in diplomacy.  

''Our understanding is that there is a very good chance that Xi Jinping is

going to be a potential future president of China,'' he said.  

  

''In the pecking order, he is right up there to replace President Hu.''  

  

Mr Key rearranged his schedule to meet Mr Xi. He was forced to use an air

force plane to make it to Auckland in time from a visit to Bay of Plenty.  

  

''We're definitely pulling out all the stops,'' he said.  

  

Mr Xi is meeting all New Zealand's top elected officials during his three-day

visit. There will be further talks with Mr Key this morning, followed by lunch

with Deputy Prime Minister Bill English at Premier House inWellington.  

  

Mr Xi will also meet Speaker Lockwood Smith and have talks with Labour leader

Phil Goff today.  

  

Mr Xi, who is travelling with about 120 Chinese businesspeople, told an

audience in Auckland that he wanted to elevate bilateral relations.  

  

A summary of his translated speech said there had been frequent exchanges of

high-level visits and the economies of the two countries were highly

complementary ''with huge potentials in economic and trade co-operation''.  

  

Mr Xi proposed a four-point plan, the first focusing on New Zealand's rich

resources and its advanced science and technology.  

  

China had large markets and cheap labour.  

  

''So the two countries can put the improvement of economic and trade quality

as their future focus.'' The two could also increase co-operation in new

energy, environment, biological technology and high and new technologies.  

  

Trade Minister Tim Groser said China had played a major role in sheltering New

Zealand from the full impact of a global recession.  

  

''I believe that more and more New Zealanders understand this and very much

appreciate the contribution China is making to our own economy and society,''

he said.  

  

Mr Norman earlier said the top-level visit would add pressure from China to

win approval for a bid to buy thousands of hectares of dairy farm land from

the Crafar family.  

  

But Mr Key said the Overseas Investment Office, which must approve the bid,

was independent.  

  

''There is no correlation between this trip and the desire by the Chinese

consortium to buy the Crafar farms.''  

  

This year China became New Zealand's second-largest trading partner,

overtaking the United States and Japan after the signing of a free-trade deal

between the two countries in 2008.  

  

In the year to April, the deal sparked an $860 million boost in Kiwi exports

to China.

@ dr who: Assault means the act of intentionally applying or attempting to

apply force to the person of another, directly or indirectly, or threatening

by any act or gesture to apply such force to the person of another, if the

person making the threat has, or causes the other to believe on reasonable

grounds that he has, present ability to effect his purpose; and to assault has

a corresponding meaning.  

  

Geoff   #28   05:16 pm Jun 18 2010  

There are many things about this event and this thread that are disturbing,

but I will comment only on one of them, viz. the insistence that R. Norman is

not entitled to have a view on New Zealand because he wasn't born here. As a

recent immigrant myself I am hopeful that these are the views only of an

extreme xenophobic fringe (one finds such nearly everywhere) and not

indicative of a commonplace attitude.  

  

Jo Marshall   #27   05:13 pm Jun 18 2010  

I am not a green supporter but am disgusted that an M.P or any one else in N.Z

should be roughed up by foreign security in OUR country. We have - or had -

freedom of speech in this country. Maybe we all need to learn Chinese. They

will be taking over soon. mello#1 The Chinese don't believe in diplomacy.

Anyway who invited them here?. Damned if I did.  

  

Gary   #26   05:08 pm Jun 18 2010  

What an utter wimp Norman is. So he got jostled around and claims he was

assaulted!! He's a big boy and should have realised that what he was doing

would get a reaction of sorts!  

  

Not sympathy for him and a waste of police time  

  

Gravey   #25   05:01 pm Jun 18 2010  

What a lot of incredibly nasty people. And I am talking about the people

commenting here. You ought to be ashamed.  

  

Ian McKinnon is particularly showing his vicious true colours. **You** are the

sort of person I don't want in my country.  

  

Whether Norman was right or wrong, it was extraordinarily wrong for security

staff of a foreign diplomat to assault someone for holding up a flag (and let

us even say yelling).  

  

Our diplomatic relationship with China is extremely important. And this is a

significant visit. Especially considering Xi's future. But no-one of good

character and sense could argue that what the security guard did was wrong -

or at the very least excessive.  

  

I feel sorry for Key and Groser. This puts them in a very difficult position.

They cannot allow foreign security to behave in this manner, but neither can

they do anything to jeopardise a critical relationship.  

  

As for diplomacy, the Chinese Government (let us make it clear here that we

are not talking about chinese people, just the Government) has made it

abundantly clear they have no interest in discussing changes in their approach

to Tibet.  

  

@Rolingeyes: This isn't about China's human rights per se, but about Tibet

specifically. With your comment, I hope you say the same thing about all

countries that abuse human rights. Including "western" nations.  

  

BB   #24   04:52 pm Jun 18 2010  

If I was chinese I would be ashamed. How dare they lay their hands on a New

Zealander, in New Zealand, protesting under our free speech laws.  

  

And shame on the New Zealand Police for letting them.  

  

This isn't China, but with actions like this, we are heading that way.  

  

kdf   #23   04:37 pm Jun 18 2010  

It is obvious to any unbiased person that this Norman guy planned to cause

tension with the Chinese visitors. Unless there is a video that shows the

incident, what he claimed to have happened should be taken with a grain of

salt. For all we know, he could be the one who was behaving aggressively while

everyone around him tried to avoid him. He just want to cause trouble and stir

up anti-Chinese sentiments, those who believe his every word are playing right

into his hands.  

  

Paul Kennedy   #22   04:30 pm Jun 18 2010  

@ Ian McKinnon  

  

Where is your "country of origin" old boy? If you have no Maori heritage, you

can bugger off out of Aaotearoa too.  

  

suzhou   #21   04:25 pm Jun 18 2010  

Norman, your voice just like a woman. Shame on Green Party, can't find a man.  

  

Bill   #20   04:24 pm Jun 18 2010  

Am I alone in thinking this is exactly what people like Norman wnat to provoke

so he gets the headlines. Naughty Chinese attacking him with a brolly! In the

photo it looks more like the media and Parliament security getting up close.

Anyway, he's got the publicity, made us look like rude, inept hosts and

Ian McKinnon #17 - "He is lying when he states he is an elected MP, what

electorate voted him in?" It's sad that people are still so ill-informed about

MMP. He was elected by people nationwide, including myself, who cast their

party vote for the Green Party.

In New Zealand we still have some rights of free speech and MP Russel Norman

was simply exercising his. The Prime Minister must react strongly to this

assault and not roll out his expected relaxed smile and wave response.  

  

This is Aaotearoa New Zealand, so only our laws apply, it matters not what is

done elsewhere. This was a foreign delegation staffer assaulting a Member of

Parliament on Parliament grounds. The Pm must be firm, but we all know he will

fold.  

  

Ian McKinnon   #17   03:36 pm Jun 18 2010  

Pity they did not rip his treasonous head off. He is lying when he states he

is an elected MP, what electorate voted him in? Vermin like Norman belong in

the gutter, or back in their country of origin. We don't need him or his

folloowers here.

I wonder if Green MP Russel Norman has been to Tibetan before? Many people

just know about Tibetan from Media, but some of them are not true.  

  

DR Who?   #15   03:27 pm Jun 18 2010  

I dont see how pulling a flag out of someones hand is assault or gettin

elbowed, does that mean we can lay assault charges if someone bumps into you?

or stands on your foot at the pub? no I think not. Why couldn't he show a bit

of respect towards a visiting diplomat? Since he is expecting that respect

towards him.  

  

I agree with 'Challenger' it was not the place to protest.  

  

Michael   #14   03:15 pm Jun 18 2010  

As an MP representing NZ he is perectly within his rights to stage a non

violent protest regardless of wether it is grandstanding or not. He did not

disrupt a meeting or physically threaten anyone. All their security had to do

was ignore Russell Norman and enter the building.  

  

Instead they showed how petulant they are in thier inability to deal with any

criticism regarding the question of Tibet.  

  

Yes a better option would be to sit down and discuss the issue with the

representive in a calm and reasonable manner but we know that is not going to

happen.  

  

Speaking as somone who has spent a lot of time in India with Tibetan refugees

and having meet victims of torture as well as observing the Chinese

governments attempt to slowly erode Tibetan culture until it becomes little

more than a tourist attraction I am glad that Russell Norman took his stand.  

  

Also if a US congressman held a Tino rangatiratanga flag and had it phsically

ripped and stomped on by NZ security or by members of the NZ entourage , you

better believe that would make the headlines of FOX and CNN  

  

Roy   #13   02:54 pm Jun 18 2010  

While I share Dr. Norman's concern about Tibet, this was the wrong way to deal

with it. His behaviour was rude and provocative, and he got what he deserved.

He has nothing to complain about.  

  

Eddie   #12   02:47 pm Jun 18 2010  

Ha Ha your all thought I was honorable well guess again im a politcian I tell

pokes if I like and cheat my way into power and when I do things like this in

parliament I can not be charged in court but let you low pepole do this in the

street and you will be in jail so fast your head will spin right off as I make

the law for you lot.  

  

Duncan   #11   02:40 pm Jun 18 2010  

So what if Xi Jinping is a "visitor" and a "foreign dignatory? He is a

representative of a barbaric dictatorship, and quite frankly he is the one who

"deserves it", not Russel Norman.

Russell Norman was perhaps not behaving in the best interests of New Zealand,

which many would argue he is required to do as an elected representative

meeting a foriegn dignitary.  

  

However, you could equally argue that he was representing the view of a

significant section of the New Zealand democratic population that put him into

parmliament because they share his convictions.  

  

I can see merit in both of those positions - but regardless of that, it is

SIMPLY TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE, under ANY circumstances, for representatives of a

foriegn power to attempt to effectively 'police' the inside of our parliament

to suit their agenda. When the target is an elected member, it goes beyond

comprehension - what would happen if one of Key's security slapped a Chinese

NPC on the grounds of the Great Hall of the People, REGARDLESS of what the

supposed 'provocation' was?  

  

Their had better be a sincere apology and statement of regret coming from the

Chinese VP in short order.  

  

john   #8   02:21 pm Jun 18 2010  

Having just returned from Tibet i can from first hand experience justify Dr

Normans actions.  

  

The chinese government are systematically and relentlessly destroying Tibetan

culture.  

  

Im talking roadblocks, constant military presence, jail time, torture, heavy

censorship...etc. Tibetans would not tell us the truth unless we were behind

locked doors due to Chinese spies.  

  

Dr Norman is simply standing up for a heavily oppressed people and remembering

those murdered back in the cultural revolution... for that i applaud him.  

  

sam auck   #7   02:09 pm Jun 18 2010  

Oh dear. The jackboots are out on this thread.  

  

People have the right to protest. That includes people we don't like, on

issues we don't agree with.  

  

What you think of Russel Norman is totally irrelevant. Freedom's for everyone,

not just people you approve of. (And I'd say the same for any other MP, from

Hide to Hone).  

  

rollingeyes   #6   01:58 pm Jun 18 2010  

Bravo!!!!! Let us not forget that China is a corrupt dictatorship with an

APPALLING human rights record.  

  

At last someone stands up for those abused, murdered, beaten and tortured in

the name of "The People's Republic"...  

  

sam   #5   01:57 pm Jun 18 2010  

He asks for it himself, he deserves it!!!Wondering if someone holds Tino

rangatiratanga flag in tiananmen or white house for maori freedom..  

  

Challenger   #4   01:46 pm Jun 18 2010  

I don't agree with what the Chinese do. Having said that Dr Norman is wrong He

is grand standing and should be appropriately reprimanded by the speaker. . Mr

Zi is an visitor to this country. As an M.P. representing New Zealanders he

has no right to protest as an M.P. He could have done that on the streets as a

New Zealander. That is his democratic right. But not inside the Parliament as

an MP..  

  

PD   #3   01:25 pm Jun 18 2010  

It's not your country Norman. Piss off back to aussie.  

  

Shane   #2   01:15 pm Jun 18 2010  

This is disgusting; the guard(s) should be arrested for assaulting a member of

parliament, just like anyone else would be had they done the same thing. But

you can bet your boots that it won’t happen.  

  

mello   #1   01:12 pm Jun 18 2010  

Serves him right. He should stop behaving like a petulant child. What was he

thinking yelling at a foreign dignatory. No wonder security put him in his

place.  

  

Russell, if you want to get anywhere with the Chinese you have to do it on

their terms so that they are receptive to what you might want to say to them.

Ever heard of diplomacy?

习近平访新西兰国会 议员持藏独旗示威



习近平访新西兰国会 议员持藏独旗示威  

(明报)2010年6月19日 星期六 05:10  

  

【明报专讯】国家副主席习近平昨日到访新西兰国会时，遭一名国会议员挥舞西藏旗帜示威，事后该议员投诉被习近平近身保镖粗暴对待，要求政府向中国抗议。  

  

综合外电报道，习近平昨日准备与新西兰国会议长史密斯会面前，在国会大厦外，身为国会议员的绿党联合党魁罗素•诺曼（Russel

Norman）手举西藏雪山狮子旗，高呼「西藏民主」，并表示，虽然中国压制言论自由，但是新西兰没有这么做。就在诺曼抗议之时，习近平身边的人员抢走了他的西藏旗。  

  

诺曼事后称，中国的保安人员公然在新西兰国会大楼内推撞民选议员，又指保安不单抢走旗帜，还扔在地下用脚践踏，其间有人用雨伞试图打他。  

  

诺曼称已向新西兰警方投诉遭到中国代表团成员粗暴对待，并要求政府向中国抗议。议长史密斯得悉事件后已下令展开调查。

习近平外访保镳殴新西兰议员：雨伞击头 撕藏独旗(图)

    外访遇示威发恶 雨伞击头 撕藏独旗  

中南海保镳在外交场合发恶。国家副主席习近平昨抵新西兰国会访问时，遇新西兰议员高举藏独雪山狮子旗及喊口号示威，

10多名中南海保镳随即出手，对他推撞击头，并抢去旗帜撕毁。此外，西藏精神领袖达赖喇嘛昨到访日本，或会与较早前抵日的疆独代表人物热比娅的丈夫见面，引起中共高度紧张，并向日方施压。  

      

    正在新西兰进行国事访问的习近平，昨日抵达新西兰国会时，遇新西兰绿党其中一名领袖诺曼（ Russel Norman）高举象征西藏独立的雪山狮子旗，并高呼民主口号示威，但随即被中方 10多名随行的保镳推撞、用雨伞击头，并撕毁他手上的旗帜，丢到地上。  

  

诺曼对此极度不满，高喊：「中国可在国内打压言论自由，但不可在新西兰放肆！」但习近平一行对此未有理会，习在大批保安人员护送下，进入国会大楼，与新西兰众议院议长史密斯（

Lockwood Smith）会面。  

      

「真是令人愤怒，中国保安人员到我们的国家，竟因为我们在自己国家为自由民主发声，推撞一名民选国会议员！」诺曼事后忿忿不平地对记者说：「中国保安用手肘撞开我，用雨伞打我的头，抢走我手上的旗帜，丢在地上踩。」他认为中方所为不可接受，已因遇袭报警，要求警方捉拿涉嫌打他的中国保安人员归案。新西兰警方昨日发公告指，会尽快调查事件。  

    诺曼还认为，新西兰总理基伊（ John Key）应谴责中方所为。而基伊对事件表示失望，强调诺曼有抗议的自由，称待调查工作完成后，再评论事件；新西兰众议院议长史密斯已下令调查事件。事件令习近平这次访问蒙上阴影。

习近平保镖对新西兰议员动粗 国会或介入



（大纪元记者徐亦扬、易凡新西兰报导）6月18日，中共副主席习近平访问新西兰首都惠灵顿时，绿党联合党魁、国会议员诺曼博士在国会大厦前向习近平展开雪山狮子旗而被中共保镖粗暴对待。事发后新西兰各大媒体高调报导，民众表示：“我们看到了中共丑恶的嘴脸。”诺曼博士对此准备向国会发言人投诉。  

  

诺曼博士18日下午在国会大厦前向习近平展开雪山狮子旗后，被习近平的保镖袭击随即向警方报案。他向警方投诉说，他在习近平一行人走过时挥舞西藏旗帜并要求民主，但随即被中共保镖用雨伞袭击并被他们抢走手中的旗帜，旗帜也被扔到地上并遭到践踏，他的手也受伤流血。诺曼博士认为他的手是在混乱中被中共保镖踩到而受伤。  

  

整个过程被当时在场的记者全程拍下，新西兰所有主要媒体都在头条新闻报导了这一事件。习近平原计划在19日上午为设于维多利亚大学内的孔子学院举行正式开幕仪式，计划有150名嘉宾会出席这一仪式。而维多利亚大学的一名保安在19日上午确认这一行程已经被取消。  

  

诺曼博士在事发后非常气愤，表示准备向国会发言人投诉，并认为在警方的调查结果出来之前这些保镖不应该离开新西兰。  

  

新西兰总理约翰‧凯伊（John

Key）19日上午向媒体记者表示，他总体上对诺曼博士的抗议权利表示支持。他说：“我想在今后，新西兰人仍然应该有表达他们的观点和表示抗议的权利。”  

  

新西兰驻联合国前任大使特伦斯‧奥布莱恩（Terence

O'Brien）表示：中共保镖这么做是很没必要的，这种做法“很过分”。他说：“我们对中国的价值是，我们就是我们——一个小而现代且成熟和民主的国家。而中国倾向于看到新西兰成为它主动权的试验场，并想在世界上其他地方也采取这种做法。”  

  

法轮功学员张女士说：“他们（中共）一贯是一言堂，并且已经习惯于此了，所以一旦听到不同的声音他们会感到非常恐惧。”  

  

新西兰《新报》主编陈维健表示：举旗抗议在西方民主社会是再正常不过的政治生活方式，不要说国会议员，就是普通民众也是一样有表达自己政治见解的自由。作为一名国会议员，在国会门口举旗，就是在他家门口举旗。习近平不高兴见到“雪山狮子旗”闭一闭眼走过去就是了，毕竟新西兰不是你的行政所在地。没想到其保镖竟然在光天化日之下出手伤人，实在是胆大妄为，无视新西兰国法。  

  

许多民众通过新闻跟贴表示：“昨天，我们看到了中共丑恶的嘴脸。”“诺曼博士站在那里，不仅代表绿党的选民，也代表我们政府的机构。”  

  

有民众在网上留言道：“干得好诺曼先生，同时感谢你在维护人权，尤其是中国人权方面所做的一切。许多中共不想让民众知道的事件都被隐瞒着，不只是中国人，全世界的人都被它欺骗着。”  

  

有民众表示：“这使我想起了中国保镖在北京奥运会火炬传递过程中保护火炬的事了。他们不仅仅不尊重自己公民的权利，甚至连外国的也不尊重。如果他们不能忍受别人抗议他们侵犯人权——那就呆在他们自己家里。”
